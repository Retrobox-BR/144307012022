		<name>3D STARSTRIKE</name>
		<desc>THE OUTSIDERS HAVE ATTACKED THE EARTH FEDERATION, LAYING WASTE TO ITS DEFENSE FLEETS. IN DESPERATION, FEDERATION COMMAND SENDS THE NEW STARSTRIKE SPACE FIGHTERS TO ATTACK THE OUTSIDERS'S MAIN BASES (WHICH ARE CONVERTED MOONS), HOPING TO EXPLOIT A FATAL FLAW IN THE DESIGN: A DIRECT HIT TO THE REACTOR AT THE CENTER OF THE BASE MIGHT LEAD TO ITS DESTRUCTION.

BOTH REGARDING GRAPHICS AND GAMEPLAY, 3D STARSTRIKE IS ESSENTIALLY A CLONE OF ATARI'S STAR WARS. USING WIREFRAME GRAPHICS WITH A FIRST-PERSON PERSPECTIVE, THE PLAYER CONTROLS THE STARSTRIKE FIGHTER IN SEVERAL DISTINCT PHASES: THE FIRST PHASE IS THE APPROACH TO THE ENEMY BASE, WHERE OUTSIDER SPACE FIGHTERS MUST BE DESTROYED. THE SECOND PHASE TAKES PLACE CLOSE TO THE SURFACE OF THE BASE, WHERE ENEMY BUNKERS AND LASER TOWERS AWAIT. THE THIRD PHASE IS A TRENCH RUN, WHERE GUN TURRETS AWAIT AT THE SIDE OF THE TRENCH, AND CATWALKS BLOCKING THE WAY MUST BE DOGDED. THE RUN CULMINATES IN THE REACTOR ROOM, WHERE TWO REACTOR PODS MUST BE HIT TO DESTROY THE BASE.

AFTER A BASE IS DESTROYED, THE GAME CONTINUES WITH A NEW BASE IN THE NEXT LEVEL, WITH LATER LEVELS HAVING A HIGHER DIFFICULTY.

AS LOGICAL, THE PYRAMID IS FILLED OF TRAPS AND STRANGE CREATURES WHO WILL SUPPOSE A SERIOUS OBSTACLE FOR OUR PRETENSIONS, AND THE ONLY WEAPON IS OUR SKILL TO BE JUMP FROM A SIDE TO ANOTHER ONE WITHOUT FALLING IN THE CLAWS OF OUR ENEMIES, OR THE TRAPS THAT ARE IN ALL PLACES. HE CAN DO LONG OR SHORT JUMPS, ACCORDING TO THE SITUATION IN WHICH ONE IS.

CORRECT ANSWERS TURN THE HEXAGON TO YOUR COLOUR, AND INCORRECT ANSWERS TURN IT TO THE OPPOSITION COLOUR (IN THIS CASE, BLACK, BLOCKING YOUR PATH). THE BIG DIFFERENCE IS THAT THE QUESTIONS ARE MULTI-WORD, WITH GEM PERHAPS REPRESENTING GREEN EYED MONSTER. IN THE EARLY DAYS PLAYERS COULD GO ON TO FACE 5 GOLD RUNS, IN THE ALTER YEARS IT BECAME 3 (PROBABLY BECAUSE PLAYERS WHO'D WON SO MANY STANDARD GAMES WERE MORE LIKELY TO WIN THE BIG PRIZES).

AS ONE OF THE SCIENTISTS THAT SURVIVED THE ONSLAUGHT, THE PLAYER MUST PREVENT THIS FROM HAPPENING BY COLLECTING EIGHTEEN FUEL CANISTERS SCATTERED AROUND ALL SEVEN FLOORS OF THE FACILITY AND DISPOSING OF THEM IN THE PIT THAT LIES AT THE CENTER OF THE FIRST FLOOR, BUT ONLY ONE CANISTER CAN BE CARRIED AT A TIME. 

IF THE PLAYER COMES INTO CONTACT WITH ANY OF THE ROBOTS, THEIR RADIATION LEVEL INCREASES. ONCE THE PLAYER BECOMES TOTALLY CONTAMINATED, THEY WILL DIE. THERE ARE DECONTAMINATION SHOWERS AROUND THE FACILITY, AND ENTERING THEM REDUCES THEIR RADIATION LEVEL. 

PLAYERS ARE ALSO EQUIPPED WITH A JET-PACK THAT CAN BE USED TO FLY OVER DANGEROUS AREAS.

YOU PILOT A SMALL AIRPLANE, AND YOUR MISSION IS TO BOMB THE CITY SO YOU CAN LAND SAFELY. IT IS A ONE-KEY GAME, SO YOU DON'T CONTROL THE PLANE, YOU CAN ONLY DROP BOMBS BY PRESSING THE SPACEBAR. THE PLANE MOVES FROM LEFT TO RIGHT ACROSS THE SCREEN, AND SLOWLY DESCENDS EVERY TIME IT WRAPS BACK TO THE LEFT SIDE.

AT THE START OF THE GAME YOU CAN CHOOSE A SKILL LEVEL FROM 1 (EASIEST) THROUGH 5 (HARDEST), AND AN ENTRY WAVE, ALSO 1 THROUGH 5. A HIGHER SKILL LEVEL MEANS THE BUILDINGS ARE HIGHER, THUS MORE BOMBS ARE NEEDED BEFORE YOU CAN LAND. THERE ARE SMALL EMPTY SPOTS TO THE LEFT AND RIGHT SIDE OF THE CITY, SO DON'T WASTE BOMBS ON THOSE SPOTS.

THE GAME, AS ONE WOULD EXPECT FROM THE LONG-RUNNING DRAGON'S LAIR SERIES, HAS MIXED GAMEPLAY, INCLUDING PLATFORM, PUZZLE AND ARCADE (IN THE OLD-FASHIONED CHOOSE-YOUR-PATH SORT OF WAY).

THIS FIRST PORT INCLUDES TWO ADVENTURES: THE FIRST IS TO RAID THE LAIR OF SINGE THE DRAGON (HENCE THE CLASSIC NAME) AND RESCUING PRINCESS DAPHNE, AND THE SECOND, IN A SORT OF INSTANT SEQUEL OF THE FIRST CHAPTER, FEATURES DIRK TRYING TO ESCAPE FROM THE CASTLE, NOW OVERRUN BY THE LIZARD KING AND ITS MINIONS.

		<desc>CONVERSION OF THE CAPCOM ARCADE TO HOME COMPUTERS. THE PLAYER ADOPTS THE IDENTITY OF AN ANCIENT CHINESE WARRIOR, AND RIDING ON HORSEBACK HAS TO ELIMINATE ALL HIS OPPONENTS, MOSTLY INFANTRY AND ARCHERS.

THE GAME USES A LATERAL SCROLL AND THE PLAYER CAN MOVE IN ALL FOUR DIRECTIONS. A NOVELTY IS THE ATTACK SYSTEM: WHEN PRESSING FIRE THE ENERGY OF THE ATTACK WILL LOAD UP AS THE WARRIOR MOVES HIS SPEAR UP AND BACKWARDS, IN ORDER TO GAIN MOMENTUM. THE MORE THE PLAYER CAN KEEP FIRE PRESSED, THE MORE POWERFUL THE ATTACK WILL BE.

THE GAME SPAWNED A SEQUEL IN THE ARCADES, "WARRIORS OF FATE", AND IS NOT TO BE CONFUSED WITH THE PSX GAME OF THE SAME TITLE, WHICH IS A ONE-ON-ONE FIGHTING GAME.

YOUR TASK IS TO PROGRESS FROM LEFT TO RIGHT IN EACH LEVEL, EITHER ALONG THE GROUND OR BY USING THE ARRANGEMENT OF PLATFORMS. MOST OF THE BADDIES CAN BE AVOIDED RATHER THAN SHOT, AND THIS IS OFTEN EASIER, ESPECIALLY AS YOU CAN DUCK OR JUMP TO AVOID THEM. AS WELL AS A STANDARD GUN (ACTIVATED BY TAPPING FIRE) YOU ALSO HAVE A LIMITED NUMBER OF MISSILES TO TAKE OUT INSTALLATIONS (ACTIVATED BY HOLDING DOWN FIRE, WHICH MAKES AUTOFIRE FACILITIES USELESS). THE SCROLLING IS FLICK-SCREEN, PERHAPS AS THE GAME WAS DESIGNED FOR THE C64, AND THE AMIGA VERSION WAS IDENTICAL TO THE ST'S.

THE ACTION IS VIEWED FROM RIGHT BEHIND FRANK IN 3D, MEANING THAT YOU CAN SEE AND FEEL THE FULL IMPACT OF PUNCHES. A FULL RANGE OF MOVES IS PROVIDED, WITH THE STANDARD JABS COMPLIMENTED BY BODY PUNCHES AND THE ABILITY TO DODGE, DUCK OR RAISE YOUR GUARD.

EACH PUNCH WEAKENS YOUR OPPONENT'S STRENGTH, ALTHOUGH GOING LONG ENOUGH WITHOUT BEING HIT CAN SEE THIS BEGIN TO RECOVER. A RAIN OF BLOWS CAN PRODUCE A QUICK KNOCKOUT, BUT IN GENERAL YOU MUST HIT HIM MANY TIMES, AND THEN WITH A KNOCKOUT BLOW, TO SEE HIM GO DOWN.

PLAYERS TAKE THE ROLE OF BILLY, WHO HAS ALREADY BEEN TRICKED INTO FEEDING GIZMO AFTER MIDNIGHT, AND NOW KINGSTON FALLS IS IN DANGER OF BEING OVERRUN WITH GREMLINS.  WITH GIZMO'S HELP, BILLY MUST SAVE THE TOWN BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE.

THERE ARE SOME ANIMATED GRAPHICS IN THIS ONE.  THE GAME HAS LESS THAN 50 LOCATIONS, THOUGH TIME IS A FACTOR - THE GREMLINS HOME IN ON BILLY WITH EVERY MOVE HE MAKES, SO THERE IS NO CHANCE TO DAWDLE. THE DESIGN MEANS THAT DEATHS ARE MORE FREQUENT THAN IN MOST ADVENTURES. IT USES THE SAME PARSER AS THE OTHER ADVENTURE INTERNATIONAL GAMES OF THIS ERA.

THREE ALLIED SOLDIERS HAVE BEEN CAPTURED, AND YOU MUST INFILTRATE THE FACILITIES, RESCUE YOUR BRAVE COMRADES, DESTROY THE BUILDING, AND SALVAGE AS MUCH OF THE STOLEN ART TREASURES AS POSSIBLE.

THERE ARE EIGHT LEVELS TO EXPLORE, EACH WITH A SPECIFIC MISSION OBJECTIVE. SOME OF THE PAINTINGS ARE LOOSE, OTHERS ARE IN CRATES WHICH MUST FIRST BE SHOT. EXPLOSIVES MUST BE COLLECTED, NOT SHOT. WITH LIMITED AMMUNITION, GUARDS EVERYWHERE, KEYS AT A PREMIUM, AND LOTS OF STRATEGIC HIDING POINTS, AN ALL-GUNS-BLAZING APPROACH IS LESS SUCCESSFUL THAN A PLANNED, MEASURED ONE.

		<desc>THIS GAME IS A SPECTRUM VARIANT OF NINTENDO'S SMASH HIT DONKEY KONG.. THE OBJECT OF THE GAME IS TO RESCUE THE DAMSEL IN DISTRESS. SHE'S DISTRESSED BECAUSE KONG HAS KIDNAPPED (GORILLANAPPED?) HER.

KONG SITS AT THE TOP RIGHT OF THE SCREEN WITH THE AFOREMENTIONED DAMSEL WHO OCCASIONALLY SHOUTS 'HELP' IN TEXT. YOU'RE AT THE BOTTOM LEFT OF THE SCREEN AND TO RESCUE THE MAIDEN YOU MUST TRAVERSE A SERIES OF INCLINED GIRDERS AND LADDERS.

JUST TO MAKE IT INTERESTING, KONG SEES YOU AND STARTS ROLLING BARRELS AND OTHER OBSTACLES DOWN THE GIRDERS TOWARDS YOU. THESE MUST BE AVOIDED BY JUMPING OVER THEM, OR SMASHING THEM WITH A HAMMER. THERE ARE 4 SCREENS TO COMPLETE AND POINTS ARE SCORED FOR SMASHING BARRELS, COLLECTING GEMS, AND COMPLETING SCREENS.

IN THIS GAME YOU CONTROL A RACING CAR AND YOU RACE ALONG A ROAD AVOIDING OBSTACLES SUCH AS WATER ON THE TRACK WHICH MAKES YOU SKID. ANY CONTACT WITH ANOTHER CAR OR THE SIDES OF THE TRACK IS INSTANTLY FATAL.
THE ROAD IS DEAD STRAIGHT ALL THE TIME BUT OCCASIONALLY IT NARROWS AND WIDENS FRACTIONALLY. THE ROADSIDE SCENERY DOES CHANGE, IT STARTS AS A RACE TRACK, LATER IT BECOMES A BRIDGE OVER WATER, THERE'S A SECTION THROUGH FARMLAND, AND ANOTHER THROUGH DESERT, THEN THE SCENERY STARTS TO REPEAT.

THE DOES NOT SEEM TO HAVE AN END, A FINAL DESTINATION. THE OBJECT OF THE GAME SEEMS TO BE TO DRIVE FOR AS LONG AS POSSIBLE TO SET A HIGH SCORE.

ALL SCATTERED OVER THE MAZE ARE PRISONERS, FOOD, SWORDS AND TREASURES FOR YOU TO COLLECT BUT YOU ARE CHASED BY MONSTERS THAT WILL ATTACK YOU.

A SWORD CAN ONLY KILL ONE MAZIAC, A HOSTILE AND HORRIBLE MONSTER AND IT'S ONLY POSSIBLE TO CARRY ONE ITEM AT THE TIME. WITHOUT A SWORD, YOU CAN STILL FIGHT MAZIACS, BUT YOUR CHANCES OF VICTORY ARE MUCH LOWER. 

YOU NEED TO COLLECT FOOD OR YOU WILL DIE OF STARVATION.

TO FIND THE TREASURE YOU SHOULD ASK THE PRISONERS WHO CAN SHOW YOU THE WAY, BUT ONLY FOR A SHORT DISTANCE. THE ROUTE WILL TURN YELLOW FOR A SHORT TIME.

THE PRISONERS WILL ALSO TELL YOU THE WAY BACK TO YOUR STARTING POINT.
AS YOU CAN ONLY CARRY ONE ITEM AT THE TIME IT IS BEST TO KILL AS MANY MAZIACS ON YOUR WAY TO THE TREASURE.

WHAT THIS ENTAILS IS ESSENTIALLY A CASE OF WALKING FROM LEFT TO RIGHT TAKING OUT EVERYTHING YOU SEE. YOU ARE ARMED WITH A LANCE, WHICH YOU CAN USE FROM SOME DISTANCE, ALTHOUGH YOU CAN ONLY ATTACK IN ONE DIRECTION AT A TIME, ALTHOUGH ALIENS CAN COME AT YOU FROM ALL AROUND, MANY OF THEM USING SOME WICKED PATTERNS. THERE ARE LEDGES TO BE CLIMBED; THE LANCE CAN BE USED TO HOIST YOUR WAY UP.

 ENEMIES OFTEN GIVE OFF BUBBLES (FOR POINTS) OR STARS (COLLECT FOR AN EXTRA LIFE). YOU ARE LIMITED IN THE AMOUNT OF OXYGEN YOU HAVE TO COMPLETE A LEVEL, AND YOU  HAVE 4 LIVES, ONE OF WHICH IS LOST ON CONTACT.

		<desc>POLI DIAZ IS A BOXING GAME PROTAGONIZED BY THE SPANISH BOXING STAR OF THE LATE EIGHTIES, POLICARPIO DÍAZ. THIS GAME USES AN ISOMETRIC PERSPECTIVE WHERE TWO BOXERS REVOLVE AROUND THE CENTER OF THE RING, WITH NO POSSIBILITY OF GOING BACK, AND WE OBSERVE IT FROM A CORNER OF THE QUADRILATERAL. THE OPTIONS MENU IS THE USUAL: ONE OR TWO PLAYER MODE, CHOOSE THE CONTROL TYPE AND THE NUMBER OF ASSAULTS AND LENGHT OF THE SAME.

OUR FIRST OPPONENT WILL BE A SPARRING, THAT WITHOUT OFFERING MUCH OPPOSITION, WILL ALLOW US TO LEARN ABOUT THE CONTROL OF THE GAME. AFTER THIS WEAK OPPONENT IS DEFEATED, YOU WILL HAVE TO FIGHT (IN ORDER) FOR THE TITLES OF SPAIN, EUROPE AND THE WORLD AGAINST OTHER OPPONENTS.

"POLI DIAZ" HAS TWO DIFFERENT MODES OF CONTROL, ONE OF ATTACK AND OTHER OF DEFENCE. IN THE FORMER, AND WITH THE APPROPRIATE COMBINATION OF HITS AND MOVEMENT, WE WILL ATTACK THE CONTRARY, AND IN THE SECOND WE WILL COVER OF THE  PUNCHES THAT UNDOUBTEDLY FALL OVER US. IN THIS CONTEXT, USING A JOYSTICK COULD BE RECOMMENDABLE.

THE WORLD INSIDE HIS HEAD IS LARGE AND VARIED, WITH ESCALATORS, LIFTS AND LOCKED DOORS USED TO NAVIGATE IT. ONLY TWO OBJECTS CAN BE CARRIED AT A TIME, BUT SOME MUST BE USED IN TANDEM, AND OTHERS ONLY BECOME ACTIVE WHEN YOU WALK OVER THEM WHILE CARRYING ONE OR TWO ITEMS THEY REQUIRE TO BECOME ACTIVE. 

AS THIS IS A NIGHTMARE WORLD, NOT EVERYTHING IS AS IT SEEMS - EVERYTHING IS ENLARGED, AND AXES, PUNCHING HANDS AND GHOSTS ARE ALL OUT TO GET YOU. YOUR ENERGY IS MEASURED BY A 'SNOOZE ENERGY' METER DEPICTED BY A GLASS OF MILK - ONCE THIS DROPS TO MINIMUM, ONE OF YOUR 3 LIVES IS LOST.

THE MORE SEED YOU CAN PECK, THE BETTER YOUR CHANCES WILL BE IN TAKE 2.  THIS INVOLVES RUNNING AWAY FROM WILE E, JUMPING THE TRAPS HE HAS LAID AND FINALLY REACHING THE SAFETY OF A BIG DROP, WHICH YOU WILL CLEAR AND WATCH WILE E. FALL THROUGH, JUST LIKE THE CARTOONS.

		<desc>TAKING A RATHER LITERAL VIEW OF THE TERM 'SLAP-STICK HUMOUR', RODLAND FEATURES TWO FAIRIES CALLED TAM AND RIT, WHOSE MISSION IS TO RESCUE THEIR MUM WHO'S BEEN CAPTURED AND TAKEN TO A CASTLE. 

THERE ARE 40 SCREENS TO CLEAR, ALL FULL OF BADDIES, WHO ARE DISPOSED OF BY GRABBING THEM WITH A STICK, AND FLIPPING THEM FROM SIDE TO SIDE TO INFLICT DAMAGE. THE HITS NEEDN'T ALL BE INFLICTED AT THE SAME TIME, AS IT'S POSSIBLE TO RELEASE THEM TO MOVE THEM OUT OF THE WAY.

WHEN KILLED, EACH BAD GUY RELEASES SOME KIND OF EXTRA, RANGING FROM POINTS BONUSES TO VARIOUS DEVICES WHICH CAN BE USED TO KILL OTHER ENEMIES.

EACH LEVEL ALSO CONTAINS A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF FRUIT. IF YOU CAN COLLECT ALL OF THIS (WITH SOME BAD GUYS STILL ALIVE - YOU MOVE ON IMMEDIATELY ONCE THEY'RE GONE) YOU ENTER A BONUS GAME, IN WHICH EACH ENEMY'S DEATH RESULTS IN ONE OF THE LETTERS E,X,T,R AND A BEING RELEASED - COLLECT THEM ALL FOR AN INVALUABLE EXTRA LIFE.

IN THE GAME BOY VERSION THE DIFFICULTY LIES SLIGHTLY LOWER BECAUSE THE PLAYER CAN USE HIS WAND EVEN WHEN CLIMBING LADDERS.

		<name>R-TYPE</name>
		<desc>R-TYPE IS A SIDE SCROLLING SHOOT 'EM UP BEST KNOWN FOR ITS EXTREMELY TOUGH AND STRATEGIC GAMEPLAY.  YOU CONTROL THE R-9 SPACESHIP AS IT LAUNCHES A LAST-DITCH EFFORT TO REPEL THE EVIL BYDO EMPIRE.

THE R-9 COMES EQUIPPED AS STANDARD WITH A SMALL GUN WHICH CAN ONLY TAKE DOWN THE SMALLEST OF ENEMIES WITHOUT FIRING SEVERAL SHOTS. BY HOLDING DOWN THE FIRE BUTTON, IT CAN BE LOADED UP SO AS TO RELEASE A LARGE BURST OF ENERGY, ELIMINATING ALL BUT THE STRONGEST ENEMIES IN ITS PATH. FROM TIME TO TIME, PODS WILL COME FLYING IN YOUR DIRECTION. UPON BEING SHOT, THEY RELEASE AN UPGRADE. THE FIRST ONE WILL INVARIABLY BE THE ONE CALLED "THE FORCE", WHICH IS A WEAPONS POD THAT CLINGS EITHER TO THE FRONT OR THE BACK OF YOUR SHIP, ABSORBING ANY ENEMY BULLETS OR ACTING AS A BUMPER WITH WHICH YOU CAN FLY HEAD-ON INTO THEM. YOU CAN ALSO USE IT AS AN OFFENSIVE WEAPON BY FIRING IT AND PULLING IT BACK IN. MASTERING THE FORCE IS VITAL TO SURVIVING IN R-TYPE, SINCE IT MUST BE USED BOTH AS PROTECTION AGAINST BULLET CLUSTERS, AS A REMOTE CONTROLLED CANNON, AND IN ORDER TO CLEAR THE SCREEN FROM OBSTACLES. OTHER UPGRADES GIVE YOU TARGET-SEEKING MISSILES OR A BIGGER MAIN GUN. DIFFERENT GUN TYPES, DIFFERENTIATED BY THEIR COLOUR, SERVE DIFFERENT PURPOSES. THE BLUE ONE SENDS LASER BEAMS BOUNCING ACROSS THE SCREEN (GOOD FOR TUNNELS), THE RED ONE FIRES STRAIGHT AHEAD, AND THE YELLOW ONE FOLLOWS ANY WALLS IT MAY ENCOUNTER (GOOD FOR ARTILLERY EMPLACEMENTS).

THE STAGES OF R-TYPE ARE MADE IN AN ORGANIC STYLE, CERTAINLY INSPIRED BY H. R. GIGER'S ARTWORK FOR THE ALIEN MOVIES. WHEN IT CAME OUT, IT WAS CONSIDERED TREND-SETTING SINCE IT BROKE OFF FROM THE STEREOTYPICAL SCI-FI MOULD OF OTHER SHOOT'EM'UPS. IN PART, THE LEVELS THEMSELVES ARE YOUR ENEMY, WHICH IS EXEMPLIFIED BY THE FOURTH, WHERE SPIDER-LIKE CREATURES WEAVE WEBS THAT COVER THE SCREEN AND BLOCK YOUR PATH, OR LEVELS WITH INTRICATE TUNNEL SYSTEMS. STILL, THE LEVELS ARE BEST HANDLED WITH A COMBINATION OF STRATEGY AND REFLEXES, WITHOUT THE MEMORISATION THAT IS REQUIRED OF R-TYPE'S CONTEMPORARY RIVAL, GRADIUS.

		<desc>SABOTEUR COMBINES PLATFORM, BEAT 'EM UP AND ADVENTURE ELEMENTS, SETTING YOU AS A LONE SAMURAI TRYING TO INFILTRATE AN ENEMY COMPLEX. YOU ARE CAPABLE OF ALL MANNER OF NINJA-STYLE MOVES INCLUDING KICKS AND PUNCHES, AS WELL AS USING WEAPONRY. YOU MUST TRAVEL THROUGH AN UNDERGROUND COMPLEX LINKED MAINLY BY PLATFORMS AND LADDERS, BEFORE TRIGGERING A BOMB AND ESCAPING THE COMPLEX. YOUR ENERGY RECHARGES IF YOU STAY STILL, SO FINDING AREAS FREE OF GUARDS (KILL THESE FOR MONEY) AND DOGS (AVOID THEM; KILLING THEM GAINS YOU NOTHING) IS USEFUL, ESPECIALLY AS YOU ONLY HAVE ONE LIFE. THERE'S PLENTY OF OBJECT MANIPULATION INVOLVED, ALTHOUGH ONLY ONE ITEM CAN EVER BE CARRIED AT A TIME.

		<desc>WHEN A PERSON REACHES ELEVATED LEVELS OF POPULARITY, THE EAGER EYES OF SOME PROGRAMMERS NAIL IN HIM, AND WITH THESE LUCID MINDS THEY BEGIN TO EMANATE IDEAS THAT END UP MATERIALIZING INTO A PROGRAM, OR AT LEAST A COMMERCIAL. THIS IS THE CASE WITH THIS ITALIAN YOUNGSTER SINGER OF OVERWHELMING PERSONALITY THAT ENTERS BY THE HAND OF IBER SOFT TO THE WORLD OF VIDEOGAMES.

THE GAME DEVELOPS THE EVENTFUL JOURNEYS THAT A POPULAR SINGER -SABRINA- MUST SUFFER TO BE ABLE TO BE TRANSFERRED FROM THE AIRPORT TO THE NEAREST TELEVISION STUDIOS. IN ORDER TO ARRIVE THERE, SHE MUST CROSS A TOWN WHOSE INHABITANTS SEEM TO BE A LITTLE DIS-CONFORMED WITH THEIR WAY TO BE, TO ACT AND, MAINLY, TO DRESS.

YOUR MISSION WILL BE TO GUIDE SABRINA IN THIS ARDUOUS WAY, AVOIDING OR ELIMINATING AS MORE AS POSSIBLE ENEMIES. THEY ARE OF SEVERAL KINDS, ALTHOUGH ALL OF THEM HAVE AN ASPECT IN COMMON: THEY ARE NORMAL AND CURRENT PEOPLE OF WHOM YOU CAN BE FOUND IN THE STREET TO DOZENS. THUS, FOR EXAMPLE, THE TYPICAL HOUSEWIVES, THE KNIFER, THE AGGRESSIVE PUNKIE, THE EXORCIST PRIEST, THE OLD WOMAN WITH HER INDISPENSABLE CANE AND A LONG LIST OF OTHERS OF CITIZEN TIPISMS.

LIFEFORMS. UNTIL NOW, THE CHIEF DANGERS HAD BEEN 
THOSE POSED BY THE HOSTILE ENVIRONMENT OF SPACE. UNTIL NOW, THE ALIENS HAD NOT KNOWN ABOUT THEM.

ON THE RAGGED EDGE OF THE GALAXY, OTHER CREATURES THAT ROAM THE STARS DISCOVER HUMANS AND SPACESHIPS TO BE EXCELLENT SOURCES OF FOOD AND OTHER RESOURCES. PREPARED AT THE WORST FOR CLASHES WITH RIVAL EXPLORATION TEAMS, THE HUMAN CREWS CAN DO LITTLE TO
DEFEND THEMSELVES AS WAVE UPON WAVE OF NIGHTMARE
CREATURES DESCEND UPON THEIR SHIPS AND BASES.

IN RESPONSE TO THEIR DISTRESS CALLS, THE FEDERATION HAS ASSEMBLED A SERIES OF RESCUE TEAMS, LEAD BY THEIR BEST MILITARY SHARPSHOOTERS, TO DEAL WITH THE ALIEN MENACE. AS THE LEADER OF ONE OF THESE TEAMS, YOU MUST GUN DOWN THE INTRUDERS AND PICK UP THE HUMAN SURVIVORS. BRAVE THE MAZE OF DARK CORRIDORS THAT MAY LEAD TO A DEADLY SHOOTOUT BETWEEN YOU AND LEGIONS OF MONSTERS. PICK UP SURVIVORS AND EXTRA AMMO ON THE WAY.

TWO TYPES OF ENEMY RUN ONTO THE PIPE - THOSE THAT CAN MAKE A HOLE (COMMONLY DRILLS, A BLOWTORCH AND THE EARTHENWARE JUG) AND PESTS (SPIDERS, LOBSTERS AND SO ON). ONCE A HOLE IS MADE IN THE PIPE, THE FOREMAN MUST GUIDE A (GREEN-SUITED) WORKMAN TO THE HOLE SO IT CAN BE REPAIRED. WHILE THE WORKMAN IS MENDING THE LEAK, HE IS VULNERABLE TO BEING KNOCKED OFF THE PIPE. 

THE FOREMAN IS EQUIPPED WITH A GUN TO SHOOT ENEMIES, BUT HE CAN ALSO BE KNOCKED OFF THE PIPE BY THE MONSTERS. TO MAKE MATTERS MORE COMPLICATED, THE LOBSTER CAN ONLY BE ATTACKED FROM BEHIND (DUE TO ITS SHELL) AND THE "SHOWER OF TACKS" ON LATER LEVELS CANNOT BE SHOT AT ALL.

YOU CONTROL BARNABEE AS HE TRAVELS THROUGH THE UNDERGROUND ANT COMPLEX, WHICH HAS TWO DIFFERENT ENTRY POINTS FROM THE FOUR ABOVE-GROUND SCREENS WHICH ARE INITIALLY IN VIEW. IN THE MAIN BULK OF THE GAME, THE SIDE VIEW SCREENS CONTAIN ANTS WHICH MUST BE ANTICIPATED AND AVOIDED, AS THEY REDUCE YOUR STRENGTH. THE ACTION IS RATHER FRANTIC AT TIMES. AT THE RISK OF BEING PEDANTIC, YOU NEED TO TOUCH FLOWERS TO RESTORE YOUR ENERGY THROUGH POLLEN.

THE GAME ARRANGEMENT IS A MAZE, WITH MANY FLOWERS WHICH REMOVE BARRIERS ELSEWHERE IN THE MAZE. MANY INDIVIDUAL SCREENS ARE SELF-CONTAINED MAZES, WITH BARRIERS WHICH ARE REMOVED WHEN YOU MOVE OR FLY INTO THEM. IN KEEPING WITH THE MAZINESS, MANY SCREENS HAVE MORE THAN 2 EXITS. ONCE YOU FIND BORIS, YOU MUST GUIDE HIM BACK TO THE SURFACE AT HIS SPEED (WHICH, WITHOUT BEING FLIPPANT, IS SLOWER THAN YOURS).

		<name>THE GOONIES</name>
		<desc>DATASOFT'S THE GOONIES IS ONE OF THE MOST FONDLY-REMEMBERED GAMES IN THE GENRE OF PLATFORM ACTION-ADVENTURE-PUZZLE GAMES FOR WHICH DATASOFT WAS KNOWN (OTHER GAMES INCLUDED CONAN: HALL OF VOLTA, BRUCE LEE, AND ZORRO, ALL WELL-REGARDED CLASSICS).

THE GAME IS LICENSED FROM THE INTERNATIONALLY-BELOVED STEVEN SPEILBERG FILM OF THE SAME NAME, IN WHICH A MOTLEY CREW OF SUBURBAN KIDS IN ASTORIA, OREGON, MUST SAVE THEIR HOMES FROM BEING FORECLOSED UPON AND FIND THEIR SALVATION IN A TREASURE MAP LEADING TO AN OLD PIRATE SHIP IN A CAVERN.  HOWEVER, THEY MUST MANEUVER AROUND AN ECCENTRIC FAMILY OF ITALIAN CRIMINALS -- THE FRATELLIS -- ON THE LAM, WHO ARE ALSO ON THE TRAIL OF THE TREASURE.

THE GAME IS DIVIDED INTO A SERIES OF EIGHT SCREENS BASED ON SCENES FROM THE FILM, EACH OF WHICH CONTAINS UNIQUE AND CREATIVE PUZZLES THAT MUST BE SOLVED BY COORDINATING THE ACTIVITIES OF TWO OF THE KIDS FROM THE GOONIES (AND IN THE LAST SCREEN, THE ELEPHANT-MAN-LIKE SLOTH) WITHOUT GETTING KILLED BY DEADLY BATS, HOMICIDAL FRATELLIS, FLYING DEMON-SKULL THINGIES, OR OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL HAZARDS.  FOR EXAMPLE, IN ONE SCREEN ONE PLAYER MUST WIND UP AND HOLD A WINCH THAT LIFTS A LARGE STONE SO THAT THE OTHER PLAYER CAN PASS IT, RUN BACKWARD ON A BALL FLOATING IN DEADLY WATER, BYPASS A SERIES OF THREE WATER BUCKETS GOING UP AND DOWN THAT KILL YOU IF YOU DO NOT TIME YOUR PASSAGE UNDERNEATH CORRECTLY, JUMP TO THE TOP OF A RAIL, AND SLIDE ACROSS TO GRAB THE KEY TO THE DOOR BELOW -- AND ALL THIS WITHOUT GETTING HIT BY A WANDERING BAT.

ONE OF THE CHARACTERISTIC ELEMENTS OF THIS SERIES OF GAMES IS THAT IT WAS ORGANIZED MORE LIKE AN ARCADE GAME THAN AN ADVENTURE GAME; THE GAME KEPT A SCORE AND A HIGH SCORE, YOU GOT A CERTAIN NUMBER OF LIVES, WHICH WOULD BE REPLENISHED AT CERTAIN POINTS OR AT CERTAIN SCORE TOTALS, AND THERE WAS NO SAVE FEATURE.  IN OTHER WORDS, THE GAME HAD TO BE PLAYED ALL IN ONE SITTING, NEAR-PERFECTLY, TO SEE THE ENDING.  AS MIGHT BE EXPECTED, NOT MANY PEOPLE FINISHED THESE GAMES.  (HOWEVER, NOWADAYS WITH EMULATORS AND MEMORY-STATE-SAVING FEATURES, THIS IS NO LONGER SUCH A FRUSTRATING PROBLEM.)

THE GOONIES CAN BE PLAYED SINGLE-PLAYER, WITH THE JOYSTICK BUTTON USED TO SWITCH BETWEEN THE TWO CHARACTERS ON-SCREEN, OR COOPERATIVELY, WITH EACH PLAYER CONTROLLING ONE OF THE CHARACTERS.

THE DRIVING SECTIONS TAKE PLACE WITHIN GEORGE'S JETCAR, AND YOU MUST SLOW DOWN FOR THE SPEED-LIMITED AREAS AND BEWARE OF BLACK HOLES.

AT THE BEGINNING OF THE GAME YOU ARE GEORGE JETSON, LABOURER OF THE SPACELY SPACE SPROCKETS COMPANY IN 2062. YOUR BOSS MR. SPACELY WANTS YOU TO WORK, BUT YOU WANT TO COLLECT MONEY AND HAVE A FUN. SO AFTER THE BOSS ORDINARY ORDER YOU CAN EXPLORE THE COMPANY AS USUALLY, COLLECT MONEY BILLS AND USEFUL ITEMS, AVOIDING DANGEROUS ROBOTIC MECHANISMS AND MR. SPACELY HIMSELF. 

ON FURTHER LEVELS, OTHER JETSONS FAMILY MEMBERS MUST DO THE SAME THINGS, BUT AT THEIR OWN LOCATIONS. LEVEL 2 INVOLVES TAKING JANE OUT OF HER BOOBY-TRAPPED HOME, LEVEL 3 SEES JUDY TRYING TO GET A KISS FORM POP HEARTTHROB JET SCREAMER, AND FINALLY ELROY IS LOCKED IN AT SCHOOL AND HAS TO ESCAPE.

YOU HAVE TO ACTIVATE THE ITEMS HIDDEN BEHIND THE HATCHES WITH BUTTONS. THESE ALLOW YOU TO PROGRESS ON LEVEL, FOR EXAMPLE, FIX AN ELEVATOR WITH WRENCH. TIME PRESSES AND YOU HAVE TO COMPLETE YOUR MISSION QUICKLY.

AFTER THE PLAYER ENTERS HIS/HER NAME (WHICH IS USED LATER IN THE PERSONAL LETTER TO SANTA), THE FIRST LEVEL TAKES THE FORM OF A FLIP-SCREEN COLLECTING GAME WITH SANTA AT HOME GATHERING THE SCATTERED PIECES OF HIS SLEIGH. IF HE COLLIDES WITH ONE OF THE ELVES RUNNING AROUND, THE ITEM HE IS CARRYING IS LOST AND HAS TO BE FOUND AGAIN.

THE PLAYER CHOOSES SIX PRESENTS THEY WANT (COMPUTER, DOLL, BOOK, ETC.), WHICH ARE LISTED ON THEIR LETTER TO SANTA. SANTA THEN COLLECTS THE PRESENTS AS THEY FALL FROM THE TOP OF THE SCREEN.

FINALLY SANTA CAN DELIVER THE PRESENTS, RIDING HIS SLEIGH OVER SEVERAL HORIZONTALLY-SCROLLING CONTINENTS. THE PRESENTS ARE DROPPED WITH PARACHUTES AND SHOULD BE DELIVERED TO THE HOMES INDICATED BY ARROWS. CLOUDS AND AEROPLANES CAN KNOCK THEM OFF COURSE.

VIEWED FORM ABOVE THE GAME IS MAZE-BASED, WITH LOTS OF ATIC ATAC STYLE SECTIONS WHERE YOU CAN SEE OTHER PARTS OF THE LEVEL ON THE SAME SCREEN, BUT CAN'T ACCESS THEM BECAUSE THE DESIGN OF THE MAZE PUTS SOMETHING IN THE WAY. GRAPHICS ARE QUITE LARGE AND CHUNKY - THIS IS PERHAPS THE CLOSEST ANYONE CAME TO BORROWING RAPSCALLION'S UNUSUAL VISUAL DESIGN.

YOU HAVE AN ENERGY BAR WHICH DECREASES CONSTANTLY, AND CONTACT WITH THE ANTS, SPIDERS AND THE REST OF THE SICKLY CREATURES REDUCES THIS FURTHER. FORTUNATELY YOU CAN OBTAIN APPLES, CHERRIES, CUPS OF TEA (I SUSPECT A GENERATION OF SADISTIC 10-YEAR-OLDS STARTED TRYING TO PLY WORMS WITH CAFFEINE AS A RESULT OF THIS) AND OTHER FOODSTUFFS TO RECHARGE THIS. THESE CAN BE EATEN IMMEDIATELY OR STORED FOR LATER USE, HOWEVER YOU CAN ONLY HOLD ONE OBJECT AT A TIME. MANY OTHER ITEMS ARE NEEDED TO GET PAST SITUATIONS DURING THE GAME, SO BE CAREFUL WHAT YOU KEEP TO AVOID TOO MUCH BACKTRACKING THROUGH THE 256 SCREENS.

Parked outside a building site, he must climb to the top so as to retrieve a set of batteries. The area is patrolled, but you have some bombs to drop in the hope of snaring them. There is a Baby Bear Mode, which allows you to practice negotiating the platforms without coming under threat. The game promises multi-colour cartoon quality graphics with animation and special effects (unrealistic on the Spectrum, but people were looking for this sort of thing in those days)

		<name>Mad Mix Game - The Pepsi Challenge</name>
		<desc>Mad Mix is a Pac-Man variant, with a typical bird's eye view for each level and pellets you must eat in order to get to the next stages. Navigate the maze you're trapped in and gobble up food while trying to avoid the ghosts that are chasing you.

As a Pac-Man variant, there are some changes made to distinguish itself. Some levels offer transformative powers. These include being turned into a hippopotamus - which allows you to step on ghosts - and a vacuum cleaner - to clean up pellets corrupted by a wandering enemy. On some levels, you can also briefly turn the protagonist into a spaceship or a tank, where you can shoot ghosts from a fixed vantage point.

As with most arcade titles at the time, there is no true ending; the game loops back to the first level when you finish the last one.

		<name>Garfield - Big, Fat, Hairy Deal</name>
		<desc>In the earliest licensed entertainment videogame of Jim Davis' lazy cat cartoon character, you play Garfield in his attempt to rescue Arlene from the cat pound. The primary gameplay involves object manipulation, gaining objects either by picking up or receiving them from other characters (usually in exchange for other objects). 

Most characters from the cartoons play a part in the game. Odie the dog follows you around - swipe him for points. Garfield's cousin Nermal can help you out. They can also carry objects for Garfield's use.

Garfield needs regular food and rest - without one of these he falls asleep and it is Game Over. Contact with many foes is draining. A butcher's is one major food source.

		<name>Slaine - The Celtic Barbarian</name>
		<desc>The last of the evil Drune Wizards who have been ruling Lyonesse is dead. Don't get the champagne out yet though, because his evil power lives on until his name (which, as with all the Drunes, is a closely-guarded secret) is said. The only person who knows it is his daughter, who is trapped in Small Sky Tower. This, coupled with the fact that she's reputedly beautiful, is all the incentive Slaine needs to track her down.

The game system is unusual - known as REFLEX, it is menu-based, but these menus appear and disappear in real-time, meaning that the game has a constant aspect of pressure and time-sensitivity. You must collect and examine objects, map your way through Lyonesse, and use your mighty sword where needed. Slaine must keep an eye on his Warp rating, which drops in unsuccessful combat but is replenished either by physical (eating food) or mental (the high of winning a battle, or having a run of time without one) factors, and has a big effect on his performance.

		<path>./Alien Storm (Europe).tzx</path>
		<name>Alien Storm</name>
		<desc>The aliens are invading Earth, and it's up to the "Alien Busters" to wipe them out and destroy their creator. The Busters consist of Karla, Gordon, and Scooter. Each one of them have their own weapons and special attacks.

When you start the game, you can select any one of these characters to play as. There are six missions to complete (eight in the Genesis version) with several stages, and each mission has you blasting aliens all the way to the end, from the streets to the mother ship where you'll meet the mother of all aliens. Unfortunately, blasting these aliens will not be an easy task, as they get tougher in every mission, and are capable of hiding into objects such as plants, postboxes, trashcans, drums, and several others. Each mission has an objective such as rescuing people destroying an UFO.

When you deal with a few aliens, flying heads will appear, which you can shoot to collect life or energy (by the way, life is important to you, since if yours get empty, you're dead). However, rather than using your ordinary weapons, you can use the special attacks that are enough to kill aliens you currently see. These types of attack vary depending on the character you choose at the start of the game. For instance, Gordon summons a U.S. Air Force Jet that drop bombs across the street, while Scooter is able to teleport out of his present location, and leave a series of bombs that will blow up aliens on sight, he will then re-appear. However, using your character's special attack uses up a lot of energy, and if you have little or no energy, you can't use it.

At the end of some missions is an alien boss, which you must destroy in order to complete the mission. Also, at the end of every one, you have to enter buildings where you participate in a shooting gallery. The object is to kill aliens popping up from several locations with the building. 

You can play Alien Storm by yourself, or with another person.

		<path>./Drakkar (Spain).z80</path>
		<name>Drakkar</name>
		<desc>Drakkar is an action game where you take the role of Erik, a viking that has been contacted by the gods and was told to to collect the three objects that will let him become the king of his people: the parchment of wisdom, the Caesar laurels and the trophy of war. But he will not face his path disarmed, the gods have given him a shield that will protect him from the Roman arrows.

Erik has travelled back in time with a magical drakkar (the ancient viking ship) and has to pass a forest that takes directly to ancient Rome, where there are his goals, but first he must consult the gods (in the game presented in the form of dragons) as the order for collecting the objects varies depending on the game.

Our hero is armed with a truncheon and shield that has been given by the gods, but the biggest drawback is that such a weapon (plus the axes that he can get later) serves only to certain enemies, while in other occasions he should just avoid any kind of contact with them.

The first group of enemies, namely the ones that can be destroyed, belongs to bats and the Roman soldiers armed with swords, maces or arches. The second group belongs to snakes and rats from the forest, fish in the ponds, the notes to the angels of heaven, which in addition to subtracting energy to Erik, leave him immobilized at the mercy of their enemies, and chandeliers, that although lethal, can just be found in the rooms near the parchment.

But not everything was going to be bad for Erik, and so, besides the shield of the gods and axes, he can also recharge part of his energy through pears and fish, succulent delicacies have been distributed for the comprehensive mapping.

		<desc>General Zoff is holding Ambassador Kryxix captive in his spaceship. Plans for a new type of spaceship are hidden in a micro-disc embedded in the Ambassador's spine. If Zoff had the plans, the empire would be in great danger, and it is only a matter of time until his inquisitors will discover them. The Emperor has assembled the so-called "enigma team", a group of six reckless mercenaries, to take care of the situation.

Players take control of all six mercenaries and have one hour and forty minutes to rescue Ambassador Kryxix and capture General Zoff. All six characters have different abilities. Syylk is an insectoid and a strong fighter, Zark Montor, the team leader, is an expert in unarmed combat and the only translator of the group, Servina Maris is the only character who can pick locks, Torik is an avian with thorough knowledge of explosives, Maul is a slow combat droid and Manto is a weak droid, but the only team member that can operate the transporter that is vital for the mission's success.

Controls are completely icon based and the screen is divided into six sections. The upper screen section is called the mission command screen and displays which character is active, the active character's location and the status of all characters: whether they are moving, engaged in combat, weak or dying or performing certain action such as picking locks. The lower half of the screen changes depending on the situation and shows additional information and all selectable actions.

From the main game screen (enigma team screen) players can choose one of the six characters and access four sub-screens:

Character status screen:
Shows a character's speed, strength, stamina (health) and carried weight.

Object screen:
Shows all objects present at a location as well as all objects carried by the selected character. It can be used to drop or pick up items, equip weapons and items or use special items.

Movement screen:
Here, the active character can be moved by clicking on arrows that show possible directions for a character to move.

Battle screen:
During battles, characters can scan the location to count and identify their enemies, move, attack with their equipped weapon, defend or retreat.

		<desc>The follow-up to Cybernoid: The Fighting Machine is again a flip-screen shoot 'em up. In control of the deadly Cybernoid craft, your job is to rescue the cargo which has been stolen by a wave of pirate ships.

Using the range of weapon systems correctly is again a key factor. These include sideways aiming guns, bouncing bombs, 'seeker' smart bombs, bombs which move around th edge of the screen before finding a target, and time-sensitive bombs which explode a few seconds after you drop them. Shot pirate ships release cargo, and you must collect at least 1500 points of this, but on many screens it is more prudent to make an escape ASAP, as some screens have more hazards than others, and not all aliens on each screen act in the same way.

		<desc>Top Cat is in Beverly Hills to track down Benny the Ball and prevent him gaining the contents of a will that is not rightly his, and find the rightful heiress. 

The game is a top-down puzzler of sorts. An object manipulation mode is used to pick up and use objects when necessary. Extra milk (for energy) and fruit (for points) can be collected. Skateboarders must be avoided as they can take objects and randomly move them.

The members of your gang must all be gathered up on the first level, and must be kept on your side by ensuring that your energy doesn't drop too low.

You are given a mission briefing before you start which gives information on the suspect and what car they drive. Then you drive across the city without crashing into other cars, and catch up with the criminal's car. To arrest the suspects, you must keep bumping into their car until it is no longer functional. And you have to do this under a strict time limit. You can't afford to crash into cars or buildings or you waste time getting on the road again. 

However, once you've caught up with your suspect, you are given more time. Your car is also equipped with turbo boosts, which you can use to gain extra speed if you are way behind the criminal. Each arrest is based on a "suspicion".

Initially you have no weaponry as you progress through the 500 screens of Atic Atac-influenced streets and towns, but fireballs can be collected and used against the Queen's forces.

Trading is a large part of the game, a unique aspect for a game of this type at the time. While many objects are lying around, many more must be obtained by entering the homes of people, and negotiating with them to arrange a swap. You can also attempt to steal from them, but you risk being caught and sentenced to death (losing a life in the process).

Fame, glory and bikini clad women await your victories and the taste of dirt awaits if you fail. Let a computer car beat you and you lose one of your 3 credits.

Successful races bring more money, which can be used to soup up their machine. Boosts to top speed, grip and acceleration can be purchased, and your nitro boost must be kept topped up. If you are desperate for upgrades, you can buy into your spare credits

Only your off-road driving abilities will be enough to pull you to first place in these races. Play alone or with up to 3 other players (depending on the version)  in this conversion of a classic arcade game.

		<desc>This interactive fiction computer game is based on the bestselling Cold War spy novel by Frederick Forsyth released in 1984 by Hutchinson publishing.  As the novel's hero John Preston, you have been appointed head of the C1(A), an agency of the British Secret Intelligence Service. You uncover a plot, named AURORA, to take power in the Soviet Union hatched by a secret faction of high-level minds.  In order to stop their plan you read a lot of info found in Top Secret folders, set wiretaps, monitor and interrogate suspects and informants, and gather facts and clues.  

The game has three main sections - The NATO Documents, The Bomb and The SAS Assault. A secret code must be gained in order to proceed from one to the next. Unique icon-based graphics provide the means to conduct your investigation though they're not mouse-clickable (you have to browse the icons using the space bar).  Interesting plot twists and developments happen during the game and are communicated to you with text-only descriptions.

There are ten racetracks, including classics such as Silverstone, Monaco and Monza. There are no computerised opponents in the game, but the tracks are full of hazards such as lakes, glass hazards and oil slicks, as well as the danger of crashing, or over-revving your engine. The controls include two keys for steering in each direction, with one steering the car more rapidly, in an attempt to recreate analogue control on digital equipment. The ultimate challenge is to beat the lap record for each track.

		<path>./Turrican II - The Final Fight (Europe).tzx</path>
		<name>Turrican II - The Final Fight</name>
		<desc>Turrican II: The Final Fight is a platformer/shooter as typically seen on consoles, but designed for home computers from the ground up.

Its plot is - naturally - very simple: an evil mega-robot called The Machine attacks the United Planets Ship Avalon 1, slaughtering all who resist. All - except Bren McGuire, who manages to escape and slips into the experimental Turrican bionic armor. As Turrican, he strives to show The Machine who's the boss.

Unlike other games of its type, this game contains three levels of horizontal shooter action in the spirit of R-Type or the developers' own Katakis. Six large worlds are to be explored, where you are basically free to go everywhere you want, since there is no automatic scrolling and the levels are packed with hidden extra lives and weapons. All those levels are very different: the first one in the rock desert is pretty colorful with parallaxing rainbow background and happy music, while the following worlds get darker and darker.

Turrican can get some different weapons for his arm cannon:

1. The bounce weapon which rebounds from surfaces into smaller bouncing balls when powered up;
The laser, which can shoots beams as large as Turrican himself when maxed out;
 the multiple shot beam, which can shoot up to five beams covering approximately a 90 degree angle.

 
The Turrican suit weaponry is not limited to the arm cannon however:

1. He also can fire a continuous beam, activated by holding the fire button. This beam can be rotated around Turrican, so it is possible to blast things below him in this way;
Additionally, he can fire power lines by pressing the space bar, resulting in two energy bars as high as the screen going from the Turrican suit to the left and right of the screen, severely damaging enemies in the process;
If the space bar is pressed when the hero is crouching, the Turrican will morph into a shuriken shape. In this state, it will roll to the left or the right, damaging enemies while being invincible and small bombs can be dropped by pressing the fire button;
Finally, the most powerful attack, which can only be used one time per life, can be delivered by pressing the fire button and the space bar at the same time. The Turrican suit will morph into a shuriken shape and fly around the screen for several seconds, while firing shots of the different weapons in multiple directions.

The gameplay is similar to the original, consisting of running, jumping and attacking, with a very dynamic central character. The laser gun can be used while standing still; moving attacks with the sword are still possible, with the two weapons combining similarly to the Switchblade games. Tokens can be collected, which will turn you into a robot to face the end-of-level enemies if enough are collected.

At the end of every track the road forks and the player can choose the next stage in their route. This feature, taken from Sega's "OutRun", makes every trip a new challenge.

Riding the bike causes energy to be lost, but soda cans can be collected to replenish it. Also, doing stunts causes the player to crash down hard, losing spokes (wheels). Replacement spokes, like the soda cans, can be collected along the way. The game ends when the player does not qualify, runs out of time, or has no spokes left.

		<name>Quest Adventure</name>
		<desc>The sequel to Colossal Adventure is an interactive fiction game with a VERB NOUN interface. 

The fantasy setting takes a clear influence from Lord of the Rings. After centuries of harmony, Middle Earth has hit problems due to a cataclysmic sequence of events - a crop failure leading to animals turning violent, and then an attack from a mysterious enemy to the north. The evil Demon Lord Alagiarept is discovered to be responsible, and as such the Wizards are given a week to beat him, before Middle Earth must surrender.

You play a rookie magician with Meditation, Mysticism and
Moneymaking skills. While the main war goes on, you attempt a much bolder mission - locate the four Stones-of-the-Elements and the Medallion of Life to enter Alagiarept's Dark Tower and kill him.

Your quest will take you through Beaches, Moors and Rocky Outcrops, as well as more specific locations such as the Pillar in the Desert, the Cave of the Sun-Dial and the Mills of God. Wolves, skeletal hands, sharks and octopuses must be dealt with.

You can also put on wings and take to the sky, or become a mermaid to explore the ocean depths.

		<name>Engineer Humpty</name>
		<desc>Humpty has become an engineer, and his job is to guide the spanner into the "works". When the player starts a level, the entire layout is shown which features conveyor belts and certain types of machinery, the latter which the player has to avoid. After a few seconds, it is replaced by large text and a small portion that shows the whereabouts of the spanner. As soon as the spanner is released from Humpty's grasp, it makes its way down the screen, the player can wiggle the joystick left or right to make the spanner in a different direction. The player loses one of their lives if the spanner makes contact with machinery or if it gets stuck on the edge of a conveyor belt. When the spanner is in the works, the game's border flashes and the player proceeds to the next level.

		<name>Robin of Sherwood - The Touchstones of Rhiannon</name>
		<desc>Robin of Sherwood is based on a 1980s UK TV retelling of the legendary hero. Robin is trapped inside the Sheriff's castle with Scarlett and Much. Once escaped, Herne the Hunter will inform him that he must find the six Touchstones of Rhiannon, as dictated by the Prophecies of Gildas. You are constantly evading recapture from the Sheriff, also having to deal with nuns, magicians and taxmen and the challenges they set you for rewards. There are graphics for almost every location, many of them animated. The screen layout and command set are typical of Brian Howarth's adventures - mostly two word commands.

		<desc>Gonzzalezz is a side-scrolling platform game from Spain. The main protagonist is a Mexican stereotype (complete with sombrero and huge mustache), that has an obsession with the traditional siesta. The game is divided in two loads:

? In the first one, Gonzalez must escape his own nightmare. He moves by executing precise jumps in one big level divided in seven sections, a surreal landscape littered with dangerous objects like flying vacuum-cleaners, disembodied hands, etc. The Q key is the jump button, while the O and P move him left and right respectively.

 ? In the second load, Gonzalez must find his hammock while avoiding the dangers of a stereotypical Mexican landscape (Indian tribes, wild animals, etc). Weapons and ammunition are scattered in one large level divided in sections. He can collect or drop these by crouching with the A key and can use them with the SPACE bar.

Bluto, UFO's, witches etc try to stop you. Some hearts are behind locked doors so you've got to find the right key to open the door and get them while others can be grabbed simply by jumping up to get them.
Somewhere there's a fruit machine for which you need to collect 'spin' items.

The game boasts a 'clever multidimensional effect' which allows Popeye to go behind the scenery and go through doors.

The action is viewed from above using a psuedo-3D display, and scrolls vertically in a manner similar to SWIV. At the side of the screen your altitude and fuel level are displayed, as well as an all-important mini-map. You will frequently have to refuel, which is done by touching down on the carrier. You don't have direct control over the plane's speed, a fact which takes the game out of the realms of simulation somewhat.

In this flip screen adventure (similar to the "Magic Knight" series) our hero must search the sprawling mansion before his time limit runs out and a bizarre security system locks down the Mansion for good. The house and it's grounds have been littered with clues and puzzles by the lad's uncle, creating the worlds biggest treasure hunt. To find the hidden fortune the prospective billionaire has to creatively use the items that litter the mansion, from tape recorders to fire extinguishers, garden shears to a sick budgie and and leave the mansion with Mega-bucks.

Another innovation, to the chagrin of players everywhere, is manual protection - a sheet of colour-coded numbers.

When you find a clam, wait for its shell to open, then swoop down and grab your prize! Descend further, to find larger clams with bigger pearls. And if you go deeper still, you may find cave systems with ancient treasures to be taken. That is, if your oxygen holds out and you can get past the waving tentacles of the octopuses which guard these forbidden places!

Once you've taken as much as you can find, you'll have to make it back to the surface. Climb aboard your boat, offload your booty, then strap on a fresh oxygen tank and take to the waters once more.

The first level is a vertical shooter level with your ship only in its basic configuration.
The later levels are horizontal scrolling and there you get your chance to improve your efficiency by collecting various power up ranging from speed-ups to tail cannons.

Typically, each stage has a final boss who needs a lot of firepower to be beaten.

		<name>Double Dragon II - The Revenge</name>
		<desc>The lovely Marian was rescued from the clutches of the Black Warriors gang by Billy &amp; Jimmy Lee in the first Double Dragon game, but now the gang has killed her in retaliation of their early defeat. The Dragons must now embark on a mission to avenge her death and defeat the Black Warriors for the second and final time.

The original arcade version of "Double Dragon II" was essentially an improved version of the first game. In addition to offering renewed audio and visuals, as well as new traps, moves and enemy characters, "Double Dragon II" discarded the conventional punch and kick buttons in favor of a direction-oriented attacking system similar to the original Technos beat-em-up Renegade.

The NES version offered new stages, new moves and illustrated cut-scenes, as well as a new final boss and a new ending. Unlike the first NES game, it offered 2-Player Co-Op gameplay with the option to turn off the friendly fire.

The Game Boy version of "Double Dragon II" is an English localization of a "Kunio-kun" game (the Japanese franchise which inspired "Renegade" and "River City Ransom" and has nothing to do with the arcade and NES versions.

Jack is an evil and wicked toddler. You play Jack and you have to cause as much trouble without being penalized for it. To see how naughty you've been there is a naughtyometer at the bottom of the screen.

To cause some mayhem Jack must jump on things, pick up objects and drop those at places where they cause the most trouble to grown-ups.

The various objects can be found all over town and at Jack's home.
The game starts at Jack's home but Jack can walk out the door and go into town to, for example, blow up the police station, kill all flowers or free prisoners. Try to get a credit card and do some serious shopping!

The first thing you should look for is you peashooter and fire peas at various objects or persons. Toot your horn to frustrate grown-ups or animals.

The naughtier your the higher your naughtyometer goes up!
The game comes to an end as the naughtyometer reaches 100%.
Cause as much trouble as you can... but don't get spanked for it by grown-ups!

		<name>Formula One</name>
		<desc>Shortly after Football Manager became a sensation, the sports management concept was applied to the high-pressure dollar-intensive world of Formula 1 racing. The top six teams of the early 80s are featured (Ferrari, Williams, Renault and McLaren as well as the now-defunct Brabham and Lotus), and you can choose which one to manage. Your first tasks are to choose your two sponsors and two drivers, with all the day's top names as well as 6 'rookie' drivers, who are cheap, but there's no guarantee of getting a good one.

Once the game is properly underway, you must buy engine and chassis upgrades, and can improve the quality of your pitcrew - all of which eats into your budget. Your cars must be raceworthy to be able to race. After qualifying you must choose your tyres for each car - rain can be a factor, and the game informs you of the expected conditions before the race.

The races are depicted via a timing board which displays the top 6 in the order, images of the cars flashing by (with a distinction made as cars come into the pits), and messages detailing crashes, spins and technical problems. Your drivers can be called in for pitstops, which involves moving a man around to undo each tyre in sequence, which is hardly realistic but does add some arcade skill and variation.

		<name>Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom</name>
		<desc>The computer versions of Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom are conversions of the Atari arcade game based on the second movie in the series. As Indy you must complete several cycles of the following 3 types of levels:Mine level: Whip your way through a mine in order to free children that are held captive. Use your whip to swing across chasms, climb ladders, ride along conveyor belts and defend yourself against attacks from Thuggee guards, bats, snakes and the fireball-throwing Mola ram. Escape with the mine cart after you've freed all children.
2. Mine cart level: Pick the right route through a network of tracks while riding in a mine cart. Avoid potholes, broken tracks &amp; guards in carts and safely reach the end of the track.
3. Temple level: Make your way to the altar and grab the Sankara stone while Mola Ram, bats and Thuggee guards attack you. Watch out for that lava.
With every cycle the mine &amp; mine cart levels become more complex, the layout of the temple levels is always the same. After several cycles there's a showdown with Mola Ram on the rope bridge.

		<name>Speedboat Assassin</name>
		<desc>Terrorists have seized control of some of the world's most prestigious harbours, such as London and New York. As a tough marine commando, you have been sent in to launch the counter-attacks.

Sensibly, your boss drops you into the action in front of a mine field, and with no armour. Negotiate the mine field and you come into the main body of action, in which weaponry can be collected either from that which is left lying around, or by docking with a supply helicopter when it comes into view. Enemy ships are all around and must be taken out. Clear these and you reach the towers, which must be shot down, and finally a 'boss' ship to complete the level.

		<name>Mr. Freeze</name>
		<desc>Mr. Freeze is a flick-screen platformer where your task is to de-ice six compartments of a giant fridge by moving from the bottom-left of each compartment to the top-right to touch the de-icer. In each compartment are various platforms and you climb ladders or drop down through gaps but you can only fall a certain height. A compartment doesn't have to be de-iced to move to the next one but you can only move between them where an arrow points. There are various deadly obstacles that need avoiding and they are ice cubes, robots, other creatures and a laser at the top of the screen. When you climb a ladder, the laser moves across and fires at you and if you are hit by any obstacle or fall too far then you lose one of six lives. You are armed with a gun and although it can't destroy anything it can push items back.</desc>

		<path>./Alien Highway - Encounter 2 (Europe).tzx</path>
		<name>Alien Highway - Encounter 2</name>
		<desc>The sequel to Highway Encounter, which has a similar game system and appearance despite being written by someone else. Your Vorton robot must penetrate the Alien Industrial Complex by crossing 30 screens of pseudo-random isometric landscape.

The main unique aspect of these games is that not only must you avoid the various monsters and walls, you must also guide a Terratron droid through them. Contact drains your energy, but recharge pods are located along the journey

Control of the Vorton uses left and right to rotate it, and forward to move. It takes a long time to slow down, so precise control and advance planning are required, especially as some screens are much harder if you start them in an awkward position (by exiting the previous one in the wrong way).

The roads are strewn with potholes, and cars and other bikes make things more treacherous. Time-trials are sprung on you at random, and these must be completed in the allotted time.

You can’t cycle at full pelt for the whole event and you need to make efficient use of energy, via pacing yourself and riding in higher gears when you reach hills, are vital. Milk (what else?) can be picked up to boost your energy.

Avoid collisions with trams, other cars (driven by annoying citizens), buildings and road blockades etc., while trying to reach the next checkpoint before the time runs out!  Use your horn to alert other road-users of your presence.

		<name>3D Bat Attack</name>
		<desc>3D Bat Attack takes place in Transylvania where the player has ended up inside the tower of Count Dracula's castle. There is gold to be collected all over the place but what's worse, there are also numerous vampire bats that roam through the corridors of the tower.

The game is a Pac-Man variant played from a first person perspective. The game consists of a number of mazes connected with a lift that the player can use to travel between them. Throughout the corridors the player will find gold that he has to collect to earn points. He has to watch out for the bats though. If he comes into contact with a bat he will lose one of his lives. There's only one way of protection against the bats, to eat garlic which he has to find in the mazes. When he eats it he becomes immune to the bats for 20 seconds. If he comes into contact with a bat during this time it will be stunned by the smell. Using the lift is also a way to escape the bats. However for each time the lift is used the bats get more vicious. Difficulty level (0-10) and number of bats (1-4) can be configured before starting a game.</desc>

Inside the temple is lots of such treasure (each worth a certain point value), but also traps to catch the greedy. You will encounter a Sacrificial Chamber, a Fire Room and a Pool. Gather as much treasure as possible and return to the jungle clearing to finish the adventure. The game features a simple 'Verb Noun' command interface, and no graphics of any description. Instructions such as 'break door with rock' have to be split into two commands.

		<desc>The main character in this old fashioned no frills shoot 'em up is a Rambo doppelganger, which the developers may have been lucky not to be sued over. The main player is surrounded by a large tank which moves around as if you are walking it Flintstones style.

Gameplay follows the usual pattern for Ikari Warriors-style games - kill off the bazooka-toting baddies, which emerge from hiding places or enter the screen in waves. You can do this by either shooting them or running them over with your tank. Parts of the scenery often block your path and need destroying. Once you clear the level you are confronted by a boss, which in the first level is an enormous tank which you have to disable the guns of.

The presents from the Red Devil should be avoided. If enough are collected, Santa can land on a house to deliver the presents personally. (Otherwise he can only drop them down the chimneys while flying.)

Going down the chimney means having to dodge flames from below and snowballs from above. Once inside the house, Santa can leave the presents under the Christmas tree, get the key to the door and leave. He fails if he wakes any of the sleepwalking children who are running from room to room.

		<path>./Bullseye (Europe).tzx</path>
		<name>Bulls Eye</name>
		<desc>A computer game version of a famed TV quiz show based around the game of darts. The computer version features 2 players, both human-controlled - on TV there were 3 teams of 2 (one amateur darts player and one to answer questions)

The first round uses a custom board which is split both inwards (4 separate grades representing 30,50,100 and 200 points respectively) and around (10 sections lettered A-K, representing a different subject each). The first player must choose a category to aim at, and shoot a dart at it. If they hit one of the sections for that letter, they get that score and are asked the question. If they hit another category they get no bonus but are asked that question - if it's still there. Each players gets 3 goes at this, with increasingly tough questions worth 30,50,100 points.

Round 2 involves each player throwing 3 darts at a standard board, with the player who scores the most getting asked a question, with the value of the darts on offer. If they get it wrong, the other player gets a chance, for the points THEY scored. This is repeated 3 times.

After these 2 rounds, the player who is in front gets to aim at a board with 8 black segments, 8 red ones and the bullseye. The bully scores 50 points, the others reds score a randomly-selected value between 15 and 45, the blacks score zero, and hitting a red for the second time loses you that prize - hence the presenter's catchphrase "keep out of the black and into the red, nothing in this game for 2 in a bed".

Once the player has finished the round, they choose whether to gamble their score against the final Prize Board. 101 points must be scored in 4 darts (in the TV show it was 6 - 3 for each player)

		<desc>The Bungeling Empire has stolen a huge cache of gold from its rightful owners, and your mission is to infiltrate its treasury and recapture it. This entails progressing through 150 screens of platforms, ladders and ropes.

The Empire has sent robotic guards down to protect the gold, and contact with any of these will cost you a life. Your method of escaping them is to press fire to dig a hole in their line of movement, thus causing them to fall in briefly, allowing you to move across the gap safely. Once all the gold has been collected, a ladder allowing you to move onto the next screen is added. Completing these screens often requires forward planning and precision.

This was one of the earliest games to include a level editor, allowing the creation of new level designs with no programming skill.

		<desc>No prizes for guessing the inspiration for this one. The Great Ring needs to be returned to Mount Doom, a treacherous task to be undertaken by Fordo the Boggit. Spam, Pimply and Murky are his country-bumpkin friends, and he will later meet with Bumbadil and Hashberry, two old hippies. The main quest involves meeting up with Legoland the Elf, Giblet the Dwarf and Aragont. 

In keeping with the humour, familiar locations become "the featureless plain below the pink mountain", "Lake Anadin" and the "Land of the Personal-Stereo-Wearing Goblins".

Bored of the Rings is an interactive fiction game with graphics made using Quill. The interface allows the player to take and use items using VERB NOUN commands, and talk to characters.

The game is split into three parts, accessed via passcodes. The tape also includes issue 1 of Sceptical, Delta 4's short-lived magazine on tape.

		<path>./Street Hawk (Europe).tzx</path>
		<name>Street Hawk</name>
		<desc>After an intensive 18-month research program, Jesse Mach's super bike is finally ready to hit the mean streets.

Jesse has vowed to avenge the death of his best friend, and goes on a mission to take down the villains whether they may be. But Jesse need not look no further than the street. The baddies are driving XR3's, so all it would take is one laser blast in the XR3 fuel tank, and the cars are immobilized.

Zooming along, the player has to serve through traffic, dodging the bullets fired by the bad guys and eliminating carloads of criminals while taking care not to kill innocent citizens. As well as the built-in lasers, Jesse's bike can leap into the air, and a well-timed spring can avoid a collision. A crash or a blast from a villain's gun is not fatal, as the bike can take a fair bit of damage before it is immobilized. Reckless driving is not tolerated, and if too many civilians are killed, the police will be in pursuit. If the police catches up with the bike, the game ends. However, the turbo facility can be used to make a quick getaway.

After driving along, the player needs to keep an eye on the gauges that indicate the condition of the lasers, the damage inflicted on the bike, and the engine temperature. Points are awarded for each of the villain's car blown up and for each civilian overtaken. While driving, Jesse receives a message regarding a break-in at the liquor store. It is up to him to take it slowly so that he can arrive there safely.

At the liquor store, you must destroy three villains who run out of the store and attempt to escape in their getaway van. All of the villains must be shot before the second mission can begin. This mission involves another chase sequence, only this time a high bonus is awarded for killing off a major underworld figure who is driving a black sedan. Once the sedan gets destroyed, Jesse and his bike can return to base for a refit so the major confrontation with the leader can begin. To complete the game, the leader must be blown out of his Porsche.

		<desc>Three distinct side-scrolling beat 'em up game sections await in this title, licensed from a series of Fighting Fantasy-style books. As Avenger, you must clear the world of evil so as to protect the innocent, using your superior strength. 

The combat is split into Hand-to-Hand, Pole Fighting and Samurai Sword fighting, each of which are loaded separately from across 2 cassettes - a novelty at the time. In each mode there are 16 moves available, varying depending on whether fire (or the space bar in keyboard mode) is pressed. The moves are arranged logically, and reverse depending on the character's facing direction, similarly to the Exploding Fist games.

		<desc>A shoot-em-up game.
You are a professor who can fly around. The game play area is divided into different kinds of rooms. There are two parallel universes (the "good" and "bad" - or "modern" and "ancient", if you prefer - versions of the universe), and you get sent from one universe to another at times. Part of the game is to collect items from these mirror worlds that have been swapped, and return them to their correct places, thus restoring the balance. In addition to this, you also need to shoot a lot of aliens before they shoot you, culminating with the fight against the big alien end monster.

		<path>./Arkanoid (Europe).tzx</path>
		<name>Arkanoid</name>
		<desc>The original Breakout concept involves controlling a bat at the bottom of the screen and using it to catch and direct a ball so as to hit all the bricks which are arranged at the top of the screen. It was unpopular for over a decade, before Taito revived it with some new ideas in this arcade game.

The game's plot redefines the bat as a Vaus spaceship, the ball as an energy bolt, and the bricks form a mysterious wall stopping the ship from progressing to safety.

By the mid-80s, power-ups were popular in most types of arcade games, and Arkanoid features them. They are caught by positioning the bat below them as they fall (meaning that you risk missing the ball if you go for them at the wrong time). The power-ups include lasers (which are mounted to each side of the ship and allow you to shoot out the blocks), a catching device (so as to be able to fire the ball off at a different angle every time you hit it) and one that slows the ball.... sorry, bolt.... down. Needless to say, the game inspired tonnes of clones, few of which added anything else.

		<name>Strontium Dog - The Killing</name>
		<desc>Mutant bounty hunter Johnny Alpha makes the leap from the pages of 2000 AD to the Spectrum in The Killing, an action game based on a storyline from the comic.

The Killing is an annual competition, where the galaxy's most notorious criminals and murderers meet to fight to the death. Johnny Alpha joins the contest with two goals: to kill all the criminals (and collect the bounty on their heads) and to get to the evil despots organizing the bloodsport.

Seen from above, the player controls Johnny on his way through a maze of more than 200 rooms. 93 other contestants are present in the maze, and all must be vanquished to win. Most can simply be shot with Johnny's blaster. Some encounters based on situations from the comic require a different approach though: ambushes await at the medical stations, and Johnny must fire an electro flare into a station to knock out the occupants. Special enemies include the evil android Steelkreeg and cunning killer Barnak Spraks, who enjoys playing dead, waiting for his moment to strike.

In total there are 13 controls used, including joystick and rudder movement, throttle control, flap and undercarriage adjustment, navigation beacon control, and an inbuilt map. The map shows the locations of the two airports, as well as some of the key landmarks, and is used to ensure that you are heading in the right direction to land. Your in-flight computer is there to aid landing and navigating, with all the standard dials and lights built-in.

Only four men, who would become known as the four heroes of Karn, survived the massacre and managed to flee. However, they were soon caught and put under a spell. The player takes on the role of the legendary Stranger from "a land where men can fly and machines can think", and must rescue the four heroes and retrieve the treasures of the realm.

Heroes of Karn is an Interactive Fiction game with graphics and more unusually, music. You can type in commands to manipulate objects, solve puzzles or attack enemies. While it is not possible to have conversations with NPCs, you can give them orders to do certain tasks.

		<desc>The Citizens Defence Force does not trust the United Nations to keep a troubled 21st century world at peace. It confiscates a horde of planes and warships, and as a UN loyalist, it is your job to shoot them down. Solving starvation and disease can wait, apparently.

The game is split into 8 stages, which are split into sub-stages over land and sea, each of which has a strict time limit, and a target number of planes to shoot down. They take place from behind your plane, which can be controlled with ‘up’ referring to ‘climb’ or ‘dive’, depending on player preference. You are armed with 10 missiles as well as standard weapons. The plane can survive a few hits, so watch the damage report as it goes from red to black. 

Fail to complete a section in the time limit and you use up a continue, but the amount of planes previously shot down is not reset, making the second attempt easier Chase HQ style. As you destroy enemies you gain access to better planes, and the rank reported at the end of the game improves – this is also dependent on the skill level you play at.

		<name>Daley Thompson's Supertest - Day 1</name>
		<desc>Ten sporting events (twelve on the 128K Spectrum version) are recreated in the second game licensed around the Decathlon champion. Each one has its own world record, and a target time / distance / score to reach - fail and you lose one of your three lives. After completing all events successfully they repeat with tougher targets.

Rowing, 100m and cycling are pure tests of joystick waggling, and this is a feature of may other events. The penalty shoot-out involves timing the run-up then pressing fire to set the angle of the shot. In the ski-jump, timing the launch and landing are crucial. The tug of war involves choosing a candidate you feel you can beat and then out-waggling them.

In the triple jump you must run to the line before holding down fire for the right length of time for each of the 3 phases of the jump (45 degrees is optimal). The hurdles event involves running to and pressing fire to clear the hurdles. 

Pistol shooting gives you limited time to correctly move a sight into position, before firing as close to the centre as possible. This is made harder by only being able to move up and towards the target, which prevents being able to correct over-movement.

You take on the role of the knight Sir Tappin, who is on a mission to track down the Holy Grail. You must navigate your way around the villages and countryside of medieval England to track down the clues that will help you on your quest. You will need to find objects to help you negotiate your way past the characters dotted along the way, such as the White Rabbit and the Knight Who Says Nic. The Quest for the Holy Grail is a trip through a possible version of history, with a liberal sprinkling of humour thrown in too.

This budget-price game wasn't the only one to gently mock it. You star as Clive aboard the car, and must travel through a succession of screens, which alternate between two different styles.

The odd-numbered levels involve dodging hazards including trees, ghosts and brick walls to collect batteries - contact with any of these costs you a life. The objects are drawn as if 3D, but contact with any part of them is costly. The even-numbered levels play like a simplified Moon Patrol, as Clive must jump over cars and pedestrians.

		<desc>Ball Breaker is Breakout variant. The player controls a paddle which is fixed on the right side of the screen and is only able to move vertically. With this paddle, a ball is both bounced into the playfield and prevented from falling out of the screen. The goal is to vaporize all blocks on the playfield by hitting them with the ball. A limited amount of missiles can be used to destroy blocks or aliens directly. The latter appear on higher levels and should not be touched with the paddle.

The speciality of this variant is the use of an isometric perspective. While the ball and paddle itself do not leave the lower plane, the blocks are stacked up. The higher blocks fall down when the blocks below them are gone.</desc>

The jungle is full of snakes, rhinos, birds and all manner of other creatures, all of which must be avoided or killed - remember that their attack paths are pre-programmed, and the trajectory of your coconuts is quite limited. Travelling through the levels involves, amongst other things, ladders, mine carts, trees, ropes and logs.

As well as simply completing the game and amassing as many points as possible, you can aim to be as naughty as possible, which is gauged by a 'Naughty-O-Meter' next to the score, with numerous objects available for that purpose (one can be carried at a time, alongside one weapon).

		<path>./Rebel Planet (Europe).tzx</path>
		<name>Rebel Planet</name>
		<desc>You play the part of an agent of SAROS, the Terran resistance movement against their imperial alien overlords, the Arcadians. Disguised as a merchant, you will fly your ship, the Caydia, to three different colony planets -- Tropos, Halmuris, and Arcadion -- to rendezvous with underground freedom fighters and gather the intelligence you require to destroy the central computer of the Arcadian hivemind, liberating humanity!

An adaptation of Robin Waterfield's Fighting Fantasy gamebook #18, published the previous year, this computer game version rejects the Choose-Your-Own-Adventure gameplay design of the book in favour of a more open-ended text adventure model, albeit one with a restrictive text parser.  Most elements of the trademark Fighting Fantasy RPG system, including the randomness of even simulated die-rolls, have been streamlined out, leaving only metrics for damage taken and hunger (hitherto untracked in the books.)  Carrying limits, while atypical in FF gamebooks, are enforced here as in the original book.

A further new dynamic includes the strict timetable of the space traffic control towers -- you need to have wrapped up your business planetside before your launch window comes up, otherwise you're out of luck.  In keeping with the game's sci-fi setting (in both rural and urban flavours), you will find extensive use of objects such as your limcom, nutritious hcaps (tasty like dead Zorkons, num num!), and the indispensable lite-kube.  Combat has been largely phased out in favour of an extension of the gamebook's espionage theme of ciphers and passwords, magic words with the power of plot advancement.

A version of this game also came out for the BBC Micro.

		<desc>SWIV was an original vertical scrolling shooter that was an unofficial follow-up to Sales Curve's hit conversion of the side scroller Tecmo arcade game Silkworm.

One player controlled a helicopter and the other a jeep, with the jeep transforming into a boat when the vehicles passed over water. As well as a host of blaster fodder the game also included a mid-level enemy inspired by the "Goose" enemy from the earlier title Silkworm. Pieces of this enemy would fly onto the screen and assemble into one vehicle before commencing to fire at the players' vehicles. When destroyed the "goose" would drop power-ups.

		<name>Gauntlet III - The Final Quest</name>
		<desc>Like in the prequels you empty areas infested by all kinds of enemies while running for the exit. Like this was rather a straight forward thing in the first two games, it's not that easy to finish a level anymore. While you only had to run until you find the exit (and besides killing hordes of enemies you probably find some keys to unlock doors leading to deeper dungeons) you might have to solve a few "quests" to proceed to the next level in this installment.
These "quests" are very basic, for example you have to find object A, then bring it to B, advance to C and finally go to D to uncover the exit.
The big difference is the graphics. While you had a top down view in the first 2 games Gauntlet 3 has an isometric kind of view.
The old 4 characters (warrior, wizard, elf and valkyrie) are ready for action again and this time they get backup by 4 new characters which include the Lizard, Neptune, Stoneman and the Iceman.

		<name>Cyrus II</name>
		<desc>Cyrus II Chess is a chess program, it is the sequel to the acclaimed Cyrus which was released in 1982.

This game has most of the features of the earlier game. The board can be viewed in top-down mode or in a 3D isometric mode with the player being able to switch between the two by pressing the ESC key. There are twelve skill levels, level 1 - 9 affect the time the player has to make their move from just 2 seconds per move at level 1 through to a maximum of 3 minutes at level 8. The other three skill levels are Adaptive where Cyrus plays at the same rate as its opponent, Infinite where Cyrus will keep on thinking until told to make a move, and Problem where Cyrus searches for mate in five moves or less.

Other features include watching the computer play itself, switching sides, retracting and replaying moves, a hint facility, and being able to set up chess problems for Cyrus to solve.

There is also support for a printer so that either the current board or the contents of Cyrus' memory containing the current position plus recent moves can be printed at any time. Additionally the game can be printed move by move as it progresses to preserve the full record.</desc>

		<path>./Great Escape, The (Europe).tzx</path>
		<name>The Great Escape</name>
		<desc>The Great Escape is an isometric action-adventure game.

Gather round, kids, and listen to grandpa tell of his time as a prisoner of war in Germany. ‘Twas back in 1942. Those were rough times, lads. Rough times. Been shot down in my plane. Darn shame it was, it being a good plane and all. Next I know, there’s this group of German soldiers standing round me, and off we go to a P.O.W. camp. Big thing, that, plenty of guards all around with a keen eye on your every move, and full of unfortunate souls like myself. Just that they do naught but sit all day and sob and generally be no great help when it comes to doing the Great Escape. But not me, no sir! I showed them Germans, I did, and I was out of their fashionable high security “he who comes here, stays here” camp in no time. You wanna hear that story? Bet you do!

Controlling a prisoner of war in a German camp, your goal is to break out undetected. There are numerous ways to freedom – back doors, cracked fences, even underground tunnels. However, you have to plan your escape while obeying the strict rules of the camp. 

Number one: Daily program. You have to attend two roll calls a day, one meal, one exercise, and stay in bed at night. Failure to appear at any of these events will result in the alarm being rung. When you do not touch the controls, your protagonist will move automatically, going to all important events. You have to detect and use gaps in the time-table to explore the camp. 

Rule number two: guard rooms are off limits. If a soldier catches you in a room that is forbidden, you will be placed in solitary confinement. Of course, you have to enter restricted parts of the camp to find items crucial for your escape. The moral flag will turn from green to red to indicate that you are in an area where you shouldn’t be. 

Rule no three: no prisoner may carry forbidden objects. When you are caught in a suspicious situation, you will be stripped of all items that you found so far. To avoid that, you have to deposit objects in a safe place. You need to find keys to open locked doors, uniforms for camouflage, flashlights to see in dark tunnels, and many more. 

Rule number four: guard commands are to be obeyed at all times. The German soldiers patrol on fixed routes and have a line of sight. You have to learn the guard’s routes and sneak past their backs to avoid detection when breaking out. If you are caught, your morale will decrease. If your morale reaches zero, your will to escape is broken.

		<path>./Blue Max (Europe).tzx</path>
		<name>Blue Max</name>
		<desc>For those who know nothing of World War I or it's heroes, this game is named after Max Chatsworth, one of Britain's Flying Aces.  Chatsworth's fame began in battle, when he was out on a reconnaissance mission, and his squadron was decimated by enemy planes.  The pilot survived, and in the process shot down seven enemy fighters.  He shot down thirteen more the next month.  For these actions, Germany offered their Blue Max medal to anyone who could shoot Chatsworth down—and Chatsworth got a new nickname—Blue Max.

As Blue Max, you go out on sorties—flying missions—attacking assigned targets.  Targets include bridges, buildings, enemy planes, tanks, bridges, anti-aircraft batteries, vehicles and ships.  You progress to new missions as you take out your targets.

You must drop bombs to take out the ground targets, and this action also represents a key danger for you.  Unlike the modern bombers that drop bombs on targets far below, early aircraft engaged in semi-suicidal bombing runs.  The pilots started at high altitude, then tipped the planes nose downward towards their ground-based target, and pulled up before they hit the ground.  In the middle of the dive and pull up process, they released the bomb.  There were problems of coordination, found in the game as well—if you time it wrong, or start too low, you will crash.

This game has aroused some controversy too, which supposedly caused it to be banned in Germany.  In the course of your missions, you end up bombing houses.

Technically the game consists of several different vertical scrolling action sequences. In each stage you must fly, drive or walk through a preset terrain. While doing that, you have to shoot enemies, avoid their shots and collect items (mainly ammunition). Some levels rely more on shooting, while others test your reflexes.

		<desc>Every aspect of the famous horse race, held over the daunting hurdles course at Aintree in Liverpool every April, is recreated here. Before each race you can place bets on up to five horses, with the odds calculated realistically, even taking betting tax into account. When choosing which horses to back, and which one to actually ride, you must consider the 'going' (what condition the ground surface is in) and which horses are likely to suit your style.

Once the race is underway you must direct the horse left and right (weaving across other horses can cause disqualification in the post-race Steward's Enquiry), jump at the right time to clear each hurdle, and crack the whip to speed up the horse. During the race you will be told how many horses are still running, as well as your own position and the identity of the leader.

The only way a working machine can be built is for this tortoise to travel through time and collect the required parts from six time periods (Prehistoric, Ice Age, Egyptian, Mediaeval, 20th Century and the Future).

Taking the role of Turbo the Tortoise, the player must travel through six side-scrolling platform levels, each of them well-guarded by enemies. Limited weaponry can be collected, although jumping on the heads of these foes will also kill them. Turbo must allow for moving platforms, switches, fragile platforms and water hazards. Enhancements and extra lives are in hard-to-reach places, often only accessible by using enemy heads as launch pads.

Try to escape from the dungeon, take out Jaffar's guards, find your way through the Sultan's palace and defeat Jaffar himself. Now go, you've got 60 minutes!

Prince of Persia is a 2D platformer with run and jump gameplay. Your hero must avoid deadly traps, solve some simple puzzles and engage in sword fights with the guards. The player has an infinite amount of lives, but has to restart at the beginning of a level each time he dies, and must complete the game within an hour. An especially noteworthy aspect of the game is the very fluent animation of your character.

The Game Boy Color and SNES versions of the game feature additional levels and new enemies. The Genesis version has a new intro and an altered set of graphics but the level layout remains almost identical to that of the original.

All the game play is here from putting spin on the cue ball, to judging how much power to hit the cue ball with, and also nominating a colour after a legal pot. Also in the game there is a practise mode, where you can place the balls on the table as you wish. Action replays are provided.

		<name>Penetrator</name>
		<desc>Penetrator involves guiding your ship through a horizontally-scrolling arrangement of caverns, in a manner similar to Scramble. The ship must avoid crashing into the surface of the caverns (which have a jagged pattern of being higher in some parts than in others), or the mounted radar bases or seeker missiles. Fortunately you are armed with both a forward-shooting laser and downward-arcing bombs.

The game has a training mode, which is useful to help you practice the game with infinite lives, as well as a simultaneous 2-player mode. There's also an editor allowing you to design the cavern layout yourself, and save your creations to tape.

		<name>Barbarian II - The Dungeon of Drax</name>
		<desc>Barbarian II: The Dungeon of Drax is an action video game released in 1988 for various personal computer platforms. It is the sequel to Barbarian: The Ultimate Warrior (released in 1987), which offers swordfighting action to one or two players. Unlike its predecessor, Barbarian II features only a single-player mode, in which the player assumes the role of either sword-wielding Princess Mariana or the titular savage, who is armed with a battleaxe. Their common quest is to pursue the evil wizard Drax, who has fled to his dungeon hideout after his defeat in the first game. The player characters battle their way through an inhospitable wasteland, a system of caves, and a dungeon before facing Drax in his inner sanctum for a showdown.</desc>

		<name>Thor</name>
		<desc>The kingdom of Asgard is in danger and only one of its Gods has the sufficient power to save it: Thor, the God of the thunder. The origin of this danger has been the death of Balder, son of Odin, God of Gods, who died by means of a dagger involved in green leafs. But in this kind of mystical histories there is always a bad guy, Loki, who was the one in charge to order this murder after knowing the prophecy: the death of Balder would bring the decline of the Gods, that would be attacked by a litter of rabid wolves without mercy. And that is indeed what our protagonist must prevent. 

For it, he must destroy a series of eggs, where the components of the litter of wolves are being developed, which are located in a castle (where the game will take place) in the distant territories of Vendha, where the children of the devil Surtur guard them jealously awaiting for your arrival. Your means to end with them as well as with other smaller enemies, will be to project thunders against them, the blows of your magic hammer, and of course, your ability with the keyboard.

		<path>./Rana Rama (Europe).tzx</path>
		<name>Rana Rama</name>
		<desc>The purpose of apprentice courses is for young people to learn a trade gradually, without putting yourself or your employers at risk. Unfortunately, nobody explained this to Wizard’s apprentice Mervyn, before he tried to cast a spell to make him irresistible to females, as the spell misfired, and made him attractive only to female frogs. However, his dungeon was soon invaded, and Mervyn was not killed, as he appeared to be a humble frog.

Viewed from above, the aim is to kill all 96 of the wizards who have invaded the dungeon, which is split into 8 levels, each made up of 16 screens and at least 50 rooms. To see what’s in a room he has to enter it, in a manner similar to the Switchblade games.

The game’s rather esoteric title comes from the way you obtain spells to upgrade the four different types of power you have (power, offence, defence and effect). When you meet a warlock you enter a mini game in which the letters RANARAMA are in random order, and by swapping pairs of letters in sequence you must form the full word in as little time as possible. This system of having a sub-game for collecting upgrades is similar to the ‘grappling’ concept in Paradroid.

This earns up to four of the Runes (Mysticism, Witchcraft, Magecraft and Runecraft), each of which can be used on one of the four types of power. The Magecraft offensive use is a fireball, defence for Runecraft makes you invisible to enemies, and the special effect for Witchcraft allows you to jump through space. Lose a life and you lose all these powers, and losing another life means it’s Game Over.

		<desc>In Monty On the Run the intrepid coal thief Monty Mole fled to the rocky island of Gibraltar. However, the Intermole agency is on to him, and his only hope of escape is to trek across Europe, collecting enough cash to buy the Greek island of Montoss and live there in luxury.

This is Monty's third game, and the structure is similar to the previous two. It's platform and ladders based, with 80 screens each representing some area of Europe - the Eiffel Tower and the Leaning Tower of Pisa are among the identifiable landmarks. 

There are different ways of travelling through the levels - some bouncy platforms coupled with a new super-leap move allow for big progress to be made, while Monty can also suspend from the ceilings and dodge his way across. Monty can now fall without being hurt, although landing on water can cause multiple lives to be lost in quick succession.

There are many items to collect  - the most important are Eurocheques for money and airplane tickets. Once on a plane you must fight off the encroaching Intermole planes for extra points.

		<name>Marsport</name>
		<desc>Marsport is the first (and ultimately only) game in an unfinished trilogy set in the 25th century. Humanity is at war with the Sept alien race, and they are now in a position to invade Earth, as they have the plans for their protective sphere. You play John Marsh, a soldier turned leader who must go to Mars and locate the original plans.

Marsport uses the same game system as Tir Na Nog and Dun Darach, although a 3D effect is incorporated into the graphics. A single path is displayed on screen at a time, and the view is rotated at junctions. The Warriors and Warlords must be shot down using weaponry, making this Gargoyle's most action-driven adventure up to this point.

The Marsport is split into ten distinct sections with their own functions, such as Stores, Administration and Computers. There are robots to interact with, for gaining information or objects. Pairs of objects can be combined to manufacture new ones. A central computer locks out many sections until it can be found and disabled. You will have to shoot the Sept before they can touch you, and also be wary of Warden robots which may malfunction and mistake you for a Sept.

		<desc>The enemy army has captured too many of your forces. Being held in P.O.W. camps, these soldiers are effectively out of the war... unless some kind of rescue operation can be mounted. Heavy Forces are too slow and visible to be of any use, but perhaps something smaller and lighter may make it in where larger forces would fail. A small jeep, maybe two, crewed by about 4 people.... minimal enough not to represent too much of a loss and yet suitable enough to aid in rescue. But of course, if these brave men want to succeed AND come back alive; they'll need to fight like animals... they'll need to fight like jackals...

Jackal is an overhead view jeep game for up to 2 players. The controller moves in four directions, button A fires your gernades (upgradable to bazooka) and button B your machine gun which ALWAYS fires to the top of the screen. Your mission is to locate facilities where soldiers are being held prisoner, rescue as many as possible, and escort them to a safe landing zone where they will be air transported away. After that, you'll need to fight a boss battle against the enemy to progress.

The park is made up of four linked levels of road, which you can move up and down at by finding a ramp headed in that direction and moving the joystick in that direction. Standard direction changes on each piece of road must also be navigated.

There are many creatures to avoid or jump over - mutant kangaroos and hedgehogs for starters. Standard hazards such as ramps and school buses are dealt with by pulling a wheelie - in this case, jumping at the last possible moment while at top speed

The lands of Ket have long been divided into rival groups and have never known peace. Recently however, particularly vicious attacks have come from beyond a mountain range to the east - these are the Ket Mountains. To end these attacks, the Lords of Ket got together and called on you. You are told that the force behind the raids comes from two people: the priest / king Vran Verusbel, head of the cult of mad monks, and their high priestess, Delphia; the most beautiful woman there is. They base their attacks from a diabolical place, the Temple of Vran. The Lords believe that the death of Vran and Delphia would stop the raids. This is your ultimate task then, but beware that both are cunning and sneaky.</desc>

		<name>The Way of the Exploding Fist</name>
		<desc>This menacingly-titled beat 'em up was the first in many martial arts titles from Australia's Melbourne House. Sixteen different moves are on offer, ranging from standard kicks to jumps, somersaults and roundhouse kicks.

The move executed each time is defined based on the character's direction, the joystick/keyboard positioning, and on whether the fire button is depressed, in a system which became standard on single-button control systems.

To win each bout you must score 2 Yin-Yangs - a perfectly executed kick/punch scores a full one, whereas a less forceful contact offers half a point - the best moves also offer more points. In the one-player game, you advance through a Dan by winning two successive bouts, and a single win for the opponent means game over. The champion in a two-player duel is decided by points after 4 rounds.

Once done, it's necessary to return to the main room of the palace in which you must formulate a spell joining the letters of "Babaliba", which are hidden in some place of this room. When doing it, it's necessary to consider that they should be taken in the same order they are written.

The enemies are many and arise from everywhere: armed Moors, monstrous crabs, killer spiders and dangerous crocodiles will try to make us fail in our mission. There are four different plants, each one accessible from the stairs that communicate the different parts of the palace. In the ground floor there is the dungeon, where you will find the prisoner. In the main plant, the labyrinthic gardens and the treasure, and in the above ones, the residences.

		<name>Laser Squad</name>
		<desc>Laser Squad is by the same designer as Microprose's classic X-Com: UFO Defense. It brings to the table an immersive gameplay environment as well as many innovative ideas that weren't available in any other game of the time.

In Laser Squad you control a group of "marine"-like soldiers (and the occasional cyborg). Before taking them into battle, you must buy them weapons and armour with a predetermined amount of credits, taking into account the individual abilities of your squad. Unlike X-COM, the soldiers do not gain experience over time.

There are 3 missions in turn - in The Assassins you must face down Sterner Regnix and his guards, Moonbase assault challenges you to destroy the OmniCorp database, and Rescue From the Mines eschews violence in favour of a rescue mission. These are viewed from above and progress in turns. Laser Squad also features a 2-player "hotseat"-type gaming option.

		<name>Spy Hunter</name>
		<desc>A conversion of the arcade game, Spy Hunter is a driving action game played from an overhead point of view. Your car is equipped with machine guns to help you get past the numerous enemies out on the road (be careful not to shoot any civilians, though!) Occasionally you will come across a weapons van, and if you drive into the back of the van your car becomes equipped with a second weapon (such as smoke screen, oil slick, or missiles.) At several points the road splits and you can enter a boathouse which transforms your car into a boat temporarily. If you drive far enough the seasons change as well (watch out for icy conditions during winter!) The enemy cars will do anything to stop you, including running you off the road, firing guns from the back of a limmo, or dropping bombs from a helicopter.

As the play field gets cluttered up with these trails, it gets more and more difficult to avoid accidentally driving in to one, veering sharply with 90-degree turns.  The player's goal is to outlast the computer-operated light bikes, proceeding to the next level.

As a policeman, the object of the game is to fire on escaped convicts who have taken the warden hostage, and in order to do this, you must make your way through downtown streets, a park, a bridge, and eventually, a prison. By rescuing hostages along the way, you can obtain a number of weapons, such as a pistol and a tear gas gun, and you can select them by using the weapons select area at the bottom of the screen. Be careful: If you shoot any hostages, you will lose whatever weapons that you have.

		<path>./Bubble Trouble (Europe).tzx</path>
		<name>Bubble Trouble</name>
		<desc>Bubble Trouble is an arcade maze style game in which the main goal is to collect all of the objects present in the scenario during a specific period of time. Each scenario corresponds to a different level. While collecting the objects, the player has to avoid contact with some moving big bubbles which will chase him when his presence is detected. If a collision occurs one of the player's lives is wasted. The number of bubbles and the period of time a scenario has, both vary depending on the level of difficulty chosen before the game was started. By order of difficulty: Novice (one bubble / 60s); Intermediate (two bubbles / 90s); Expert (three bubbles / 120s).

To complete a level it's imperative to acquire at least all of the objects present in the scenario during the mentioned periods of time. Only then, the player can start accumulating points which will randomly appear in the maze in the form of collectable objects. These "objects" start to appear in a succession of pairs of 200, 500, 700 and 1000 points. After all the points in the double succession are picked up, a question mark shows up on a random point of the maze. If successively picked it will allow the player to immediately finish the level without having to wait for the rest of the necessary time to pass the level.</desc>

The rules of squash are accurately recreated, with a realistic court layout (viewed isometrically) and a need to hit legal shots. Three different ball speeds, variable match lengths and an 'easy' mode are on offer. Different tournament types are on offer, at 'club' and 'tournament' levels, with a customisable ladder system of multiple divisions to rise up. There is a full roster of opponents to play in one-off or tournament modes.

		<name>Garfield - Winter's Tail</name>
		<desc>After a fruitful day spent on his favorite hobby (food, what else?), Garfield the cat falls asleep next to Jon's still open fridge. The chill coming out of the refrigerator induces a dream of the Swiss Alps, with Garfield going after the largest lasagna factory in the world and a mythical chicken that can lay chocolate eggs. It is the player's goal to make sure Garfield's dream comes to a happy ending before he wakes up. 

Garfield: Winter's Tail comprises of three different mini-games.The first one has Garfield skiing downhill towards a ski-jump that will lead him straight to the rooftop of the lasagna factory. The second mini-game is set in the chocolate factory where the mythical chicken is employed: Garfield must ensure all the mechanical chickens in the factory are provided their chocolate supply flowing through a pipeline. Finally, he must ice-skate across a frozen lake, following the trail of chocolate footsteps left by the chicken.

As a disturbing element, Odie appears throughout the whole game. The drooling dog can steal some of the food Garfield needs to replenish his energy, but he can also tamper with the lift controls in the factory and saw holes in the frozen lake.

The three mini-games can be played in any order. However, playing the whole game from the skiing level first is the only way to be able to see the ending.

		<desc>The ancient game of chess is recreated here, with all the traditional rules and game concepts. The game is in 2D, as the programmers felt this was the most effective use of available memory. Controls involve moving a pointer over the square to move a piece from, pressing space, then moving to the destination square and pressing space again. You can set the amount of time players (human and computer) have to plan moves, although an over-ride option to force a move instantly also exists. You can save and reload games, and at any point can move pieces either from current settings or from scratch, to completely customise the game or play out classic positions.

Only one person, might be able to overcome the rocky system Kerman and enter the fortress. Krugger is his name, although most of his enemies know him as Bestial Warrior.

Armed to the teeth, he will enter into the system and will need of your guidance and help to reach their goal: finding the three parts of the C70-Magnum, a devastating weapon.

During the tour you can find objects that give greater power to your weapon, extra lives, temporary immunity and load cells, which are of great importance, as those allow you to pass from one level to another after finding the screen scroll.

The enemies are of different types, all fairly heavy and aggressive, specially these known as Bartoks, which guard the exists of the different sectors and require a lot of shots to be definitely killed.

The levels contain various hazards and enemies travelling on fixed patterns, who must be dodged by jumping them. Progression through the screens isn't always linear as one room often requires a key which is located a couple of rooms away. 

The screens have ladders to climb/descend, ropes to grab and descend, gaps to jump, on/off platforms to navigate via timing, keys to collect, doors to unlock and rolling log platforms to run across quickly. Items such as torches, gems and swords can also be collected. The game has 3 difficulty levels.

But the legendary warrior Rygar rises from his grave to restore peace and justice. Armed with his famed weapon Diskarmor, Rygar begins to traverse the vast lands that lead to the lair of the demon, as his minions are trying in vain to stop him...

Originally released on the arcades, Rygar is a side-scrolling action game. The player controls the titular hero, advancing through stages populated by hostile creatures. Beside the Diskarmor, a weapon that looks like a shield with a chain attached to it, the hero can use a variety of other weapons, including projectiles that can be fired in four directions. Various "powers" are scattered through the levels and can be collected. The effects of these powers include increasing the fire power of the equipped weapon, adding time to the clock, temporary invisibility, extra points, etc.

The black crow and the white crow are out to beat each other before the time bell rings. Find the needed objects by digging through drawers, closets and furniture in the house. Foil your opponent by setting creative booby traps in the various rooms (a bomb in a dresser drawer, for instance).

Fights ensue when both spies enter the same room.  Find hidden weapons in the rooms to help with those fights, since one of you will die if you run into each other.

		<name>Nosferatu the Vampyre</name>
		<desc>This game shares two major similarities to The Great Escape - firstly, it's licensed around a venerable film, using the setting to new effect. Secondly, it's isometrically-viewed (with monochrome graphics, even on the capable-of-far-better C64) and features full object interaction of the Filmation style - this is taken further here, as the physics of the objects are varied by their shape and centre of gravity.

There are three stages to complete. In the first you play Johnathan Harker, who must retrieve some papers (he works for an Estate Agent's) and escape the castle. The second level introduces Johnathan's wife Lucy, and van Helsing, with play switching between the three. Lucy's role is slightly different as it is she who pursues the vampire itself, and she takes on the task alone in level 3.

Food must be collected to keep the characters' strength up, and crucifixes and candles can be picked up to help matters.

		<desc>In this stage coach game you control two characters (in one player mode, in two player mode you can choose your character), the rider of the stage coach and the man on top of the stage coach, the riffle man.

A new stage coach service has been set up by Wells and Fargo. And it is your job to protect the transported cargo. The stage coach route goes through hostile territories and it is full of hazards.

You have to keep the stage coach on the road (as the stage coach rider) and shoot hostile hazards (as the man with the riffle).

		<desc>You are Monty and you are about to attempt to fulfill your life's ambitions, become rich and be a hero. You have the opportunity to rescue a Princess while collecting gold nuggets on the way. The game consists of 40 single screen rooms viewed from above at an elevated angle, and to leave each room you must collect all the gold nuggets scattered around within a time limit, and once all the gold is collected then you can leave by the opened door. Moving around each room are various creatures and if you touch any, then you lose one of five lives, and failing also to complete the room within the time limit also loses a life. The joystick is used to control Monty and once you move him in a direction he keeps moving until he hits an object but he can change direction as he moves. Also to note is that the longer you hold the joystick in a direction the faster Monty moves.</desc>

		<path>./Hard Drivin' (Europe).tzx</path>
		<name>Hard Drivin'</name>
		<desc>Hard Drivin' is a 3D arcade hit from Atari Games. You are in control of a high-performance sports car. Your objective is to race around the course as fast as possible and hit as many checkpoints as possible. If you hit a checkpoint you gain extra time to go farther. You will see traffic on the road both in your direction and coming down the opposite direction, so be careful when you pass... 

The course has two sections: speed track, and stunt track. Speed track is longer, but you can usually achieve higher speeds. Stunt track requires you to perform several stunts such as jumping bridges, driving through a loop, and so on. 

Crashing the car has no serious consequences and indeed shows a replay of your crash from a cinematic angle. Admire your crash head-on into the cement truck, or clipping the minivan, or flying off the bridge in the wrong angle... You lose several seconds as your car is "reset" and you get up to speed again. 

The home conversions retain most of the then-advanced 3D graphics but lack the force-feedback that was in the arcade version.

If you didn't destroy/kill enough, you'll be transported to a training mission, which is a first-person perspective shoot 'em up. Should you also fail the training, you must go to the beginning of the previous mission. Successfully completed mission or enough points scored by training allow you to proceed to the next stage. Unlike in the first RoboCop, there's no time limit, and you are able to jump.

		<desc>The object of this game is to get rid of your opponents (pigs) by throwing bombs at them. When they are thrown, the bombs will count down from the number shown on the bomb, and explode when they reach zero. But they will explode immediately once they hit their target, regardless of the countdown. Items can be picked up along the way that will help you defeat opponents. One of them is a knapsack that allows you to carry more than one bomb at a time. After certain levels, a bonus game appears, and the object of this game is to attempt to kiss the lady pigs as they pop in and out of their holes.

		<desc>On childrens TV in the early 90s, Edd the Duck and Wilson the arm were the familiar puppets helping with the link sections. Like most child-oriented licenses of the day, his first computer outing was a platform game, scrolling vertically and resembling Rainbow Islands, although much simplified.

Edd must progress up the levels within the time limit (water will come up to drown him - presumably polluted water through which a duck can't swim), while collecting every star. Bad guys can be stunned by shooting them, which makes them safe to touch, although nothing other than Edd actually dies. The levels are all themed around particular areas of the BBC offices, including a sci-fi set and the weather room.

		<desc>La Espada Sagrada is an arcade-videoadventure mix that consists of 3 phases, 2 of them inspired by the classic videoadventure genre of the eighties and the third being a classical arcade game.

The hero player (Atahualpa Yupanqui) aims to obtain 'The Sacred Sword', and problems through the 2 early stages must be solved in order to find it. Then in a third phase full of action, take advantage of that sword to be victorious.

The two early stages have no side scrolling, while the third one is an arcade with horizontal scroll and non-stop action and big sprites.

To access levels 2 and 3 you need a code, which is provided once you finish the previous one.

		<path>./Denis through the Drinking Glass (Europe).tzx</path>
		<name>Denis through the Drinking Glass</name>
		<desc>Margaret Thatcher's late husband Denis was known to like a drop of gin, a fact frequently exploited by satirical magazine Private Eye. As such, this text adventure stars you as Denis, on his quest to escape Number 10 Downing Street (and Maggie) to get to the Gravedigger's Arms pub.

Denis must get a drink within 10 moves, or else it is game over. The location descriptions are written in an unusual style, set to rhyme and featuring wry observations about the drudgery of political life from Denis' unique position. Similarly, the Help feature often gives terse, sarcastic and less-than-helpful responses.

As you progress through the game, mock headlines from The Sun newspaper appear to comment on your situations. The game is written in Quill, a popular adventure creation package from Gilsoft themselves.

		<name>Crazy Golf</name>
		<desc>Nine holes of chaotic top-viewed ricochets and hazards make up this early Crazy Golf game. They can be skipped for a score of 12 if you get stuck. There are no moving hazards, so gameplay is essentially a golf-themed precise positioning puzzle. Furthering this aspect, it does not matter what pace the ball it at when it reaches the hole (it never rebounds out of it) and that rebounds are always at precise 90-degree angles without taking pace out of the ball.

Sixteen shot angles and sixteen shot paces are available. The first hole is simply a row of vertically-placed barriers with only small gaps at each end, but later holes include randomly-placed ball-sized blocks, curved barriers almost enclosing the hole, and square blockades leaving only narrow corridors to play (bounce, more effectively) the ball through. The final hole combines all these for a par-12 challenge.

		<path>./Elevator Action (Europe).tzx</path>
		<name>Elevator Action</name>
		<desc>You are Agent 17 (codename: "Otto"). Your mission is to secure all top secret documents from a security building and escape in the getaway car, located in the basement of the building.

Enemies spies are scattered throughout the 30-floor building and they have only one mission: execute Agent 17 at all costs. There are several ways in which Agent 17 can kill them:

1. Shooting them with his gun.
2. Kicking them by jumping onto them.
3. Shooting a light on the ceiling while in an elevator, dropping the light onto one of them.
4. Crushing them with an elevator.

Whenever a light has been dropped, the hallways will be dark for a short period of time, making the enemy spies harder to see. The same holds true for hallways that are already dark.

While Otto is in an elevator, he will have complete control of it by moving up or down. Agent 17 can still get killed if he's already in an elevator if a bullet's trajectory is aimed at it.. When Otto is not in an elevator, it will move from floor to floor automatically, even when enemy spies are in it. Otto is able to leap over the elevator gaps, but he must be as close to the edge as possible without falling off in order to make the jump safely. If there is an elevator cable in the way, however, it will block him, causing him to fall. 

Just because the game is called Elevator Action doesn't mean that elevators are the only means of travel. There are also escalators which you can ride up or down, useful if you want to avoid gunfire and don't have time to jump.

Otto must go into the rooms with red doors to collect the top secret documents. If he tries to get to his car without getting all the documents, he cannot escape and must go back and collect the remaining documents. Once he has all the documents and drives away, he then proceeds to the next building.

If Otto takes too much time to collect the documents, the alarm will go off, and he will have trouble controlling the elevators, which will take time to react. Bad guys will be especially aggressive. The alarm doesn't go off when Otto loses a life, it only resets after finishing a building. Besides ducking, bad guys may also drop themselves and lay flat on the floor. It's virtually impossible for Otto to shoot bad guys when they do this. Also, Otto cannot duck when in an elevator.

You'll be foraging both above and below ground, with rabbits and hens on offer to kill, and apples and milk (yes, I know foxes are purely carnivorous) can be collected. All of this must be brought back to the home before to complete each level. All manner of nasties are thrown at you, including eggs (from hens), nuts (from squirrels) and rocks (from badgers)

		<desc>Implanting subliminal messages in music seemingly worked for Judas Priest - the evil Dr. Blitzen is trying to make it work for himself, by planting messages in popular records. Blitzen has used the 8 islands of Arcanium for this task - each contains a jukebox as well as a record containing a clue to the location of the secret factory in which he produces these horrors. Dynamite Dan is back to put a stop to this, by exploring the 8 islands in turn to find the pieces of the puzzle.

There are 192 screens in total - 24 on each island - all loaded with enemies on fixed attack patterns. Some move diagonally, others home in on Dan, and some move horizontally - all of them detract from Dan's energy level, eventually leading to death and failure, and some can steal objects from him. The record and jukebox are randomly placed on each go, as are the enemies. Dan can jump far, and his jumps are bigger if he has taken a run-up.

There are many objects to collect - a torch for theft protection, bomb goggles to blow doors open, foods for restored energy (and a mixer for infinite energy), and dumbells to increase jump size. All of these are used automatically. To escape each island he must also find enough fuel for his trusty Zeppelin.

		<desc>Rapscallion the Rogue has captured the ownership rights to your castle, and imprisoned you out in the wilderness. Fortunately, your friend the Princess has transformed you into a bird, allowing you to escape and begin your quest for vengeance in this arcade adventure.

The screens are linked in a maze fashion, with most having multiple exits, and each has its own hazards. These include marauding cats, dual spikes that close in on you, bolts of electricity fired out from linked points, spiders, and loads more. The graphical style is large and blocky, and certainly out of the ordinary. You can change between a fly and a bird, each of which is immune to some hazards. When you lose a life, you change into a ghost, which can fly around unimpeded, but can’t do anything productive, so your first task is to find a pixie and change back.

		<name>Eskimo Eddie</name>
		<desc>Eskimo Eddie is an arcade adventure set in the Ice Age. The game is split into two levels. The first level varies between the Commodore 64 and ZX Spectrum versions. 

In the C64 version, Eddie must make his way toward Percy Penguin who has been captured by a polar bear named Growler. This can be done by navigating a series of platforms while jumping over snowballs Growler throws at him. Eddie only needs to rescue Percy once before he can move on to the next level.

In the Spectrum version, the first level has Eddie collecting Percy, who is at the top of the screen, and bring him back to the bottom. He must deal with two Growlers who swim across the screen, and avoid jagged ice holes that slide all over the screen. Eddie must rescue Percy thrice before he moves on to the next level.

In the second level, the entire screen is filled with ice blocks, which disappear one by one to form a maze. Percy appears in the middle of the maze. Four snowbugs also appear and start traveling around the maze, in an attempt to kill Percy. Percy needs to squash all snowbugs in the maze by pushing the ice blocks into them. The ice blocks can also be melted so that more space is created, allowing Percy to pass through. Any snowbug that touches the maze's electrified edges become dazed, allowing Percy to destroy them easily.

The fact that you play Airtight gives the game its unusual nature. You control a cursor, which must hit each of the potential threats before Quick Kick gets to them. These include enemies throwing barrels, shooting enemies on foot, and fighters hidden in bins. As Quick Kick completes each screen the display moves on to the next one. Shooting the US flags which occasionally appear will restore Quick Kick's energy.

		<name>WWF Wrestle Mania</name>
		<desc>At the height of the World Wrestling Federation's European fame came this crunching recreation of the elaborate hammed-up action. Hulk Hogan, The Ultimate Warrior or the British Bulldog can come under your control.

You play either in practice matches (against the hopefully-misnamed Mr Perfect) or in a sequence of 5 matches to win the Wrestlemania Belt. Your opponents have different special moves - watch out for The Warlord's Full Nelson and Sgt. Slaughter's Camel Clutch, for example. Before the fights start, your opponents will deliver a taunt, which you must respond to as creatively as possible.

The game is a beat 'em up viewed from a forced perspective above and behind the action. Your aim is to pin your opponent to the ground for 3 seconds, which can only be done once he has been weakened. Kicks, punches and throws will reduce an opponent's strength bar. When a strong opponent is down, stamping on him will pay off more than attempting a pin.

Avoid leaving the ring for too long - 20 seconds out and the match is void, which counts as a defeat. As in real WWF, the frame of the arena can be used to perform moves. Once players are in close contact, waggle the joystick to ensure you win the grapple.

The bulk of the game is a flick-screen fighting game, similar to the Joe Blade series. Prisoners can be attacked with your rifle, or by kicking them in the head. Any other contact drains energy, and you have only one life. Keys are required to open security doors; these plus extra bullets and energy can be collected as you go.

This is an arcade adventure resembling the other Wally Week games, although it represents David Perry's design debut. There are many animals to avoid including stinging bees and butterflies, but the toughest foe is the Indian chief, best avoided with a well-timed jump. There are multi-stage puzzles to solve on each screen, and a limit of carrying 2 objects at a time.

The setting is largely jungle, but there are forests, beaches and huts amongst other things to explore as well. Movement between screens is generally from left to right, but you will go into the screen via signposted sections, and occasionally travel vertically as well.

		<path>./Firefly (Europe).tzx</path>
		<name>Firefly</name>
		<desc>In the game, you, as commander of the Firefly, must destroy the 'mechanoid system framework' that your enemy has created by destroying its energy source.

The framework is represented as a grid of squares or sectors.  Ultimately you must reach and destroy the power source, at the far right of the grid, whilst at the start of the game you only have access to the 'dead zone', at the far left of the grid, and those squares immediately adjacent.  This can be extended as described below.

Planetary sectors are systems with planets in them, and cannot be entered as they are the enemy's main colonies, so are too well defended.  Thus they block the path.

Unconstructed regions can be taken over, turning them into part of the dead zone, by bypassing the 'instrusion detection' alarm system.  The system involves the cursor flicking between 'thumbs up' and 'thumbs down' symbols, and you must press fire when 'thumbs up' is displayed to take over the system.  A thumbs down will scramble the squares on the grid.

The main part of the game takes place when you try to take over an occupied zone.  Here the game is a shoot-em-up, where you can move freely in two dimensions, and shoot at your enemies.  Your ammunition orbits you, and when fired takes a moment to come back to you, so you can temporarily run out of ammo if you fire too quickly.  .

In an occupied zone there are 4 energy points that you must destroy.  To destroy an energy source you must collect 4 zokas, or excess energy units from it, then enter, and select a thumbs up as  the cursor alternates between it and a thumbs down.  The cursor alternates more quickly in successive energy points.  

Teleports can be used, to move between areas, but when you attempt to use one, your ship rotates whilst pointing at a set of alternating green and red dots in a circle.  You must hit the fire button 3 times in succession, when the ship is pointing at a green dot, with the ship spinning faster each time. 

If you take too much damage your ship explodes, and you lose a life, and re-enter the grid, with the occupied zone still occupied.  However, if you successfully destroy all 4 energy points, the occupied zone becomes part of the dead zone as you re-enter the grid.

The game is set on the mean streets of Brooklyn, which you must venture through to meet your girlfriend, and then rescue her from her kidnappers. This is split into five levels, taking you through the subway and the docks as well as some inhospitable streets. A wide range of aggressive moves are on offer, including headbutts, kicks, punches and flying kicks. Much of the game's violence is depicted in a fairly tongue-in-cheek style, with an element of attempted humour along the way.

In the game, Hen House Harry must build a giant chocolate egg, with the ingredients (cocoa, milk and sugar), that are found in the factory.  Eight of each must be included.  Also, the eight parts of a toy kit must be found, to place inside the egg.

In order to get all the items you must find your way around the factory, avoiding many types of enemy, and solving puzzles using various items that you can carry.  There are a number of ways to get around the factory, including the platforms of the original, but also ropes and pipes, among other things.

Despite the drastic changes from the original, the game still retains the sound effects from the original.

You take control of a wizard, a dwarf, a barbarian and an elf, each with different strengths and weaknesses, who each start the 14 missions from opposite sides of the board.

Strict turn-based movement rules apply, as actions other than movement can only be carried out before or after the move, the size of which is limited by a dice roll. These moves are carried out using an icon-based system. Characters can fight the many monsters which lurk, or cast spells to vanquish them. There are magic potions to uncover, but also hidden traps, so mapping is advised. Treasure can be collected, and traded at the shop after each level.

This adventure is written using GAC (Graphic Adventure Creator); as such, most of the screen features visual representations of your surroundings, with text input at the bottom of the screen. Commands are object-sensitive - if you have just GETted a hat, WEAR IT will mean 'WEAR HAT'. The standard commands are joined by a few which you will only need in one situation. Simple directional commands (w, s, up and so on) are used less frequently than in most IF games.

		<name>Simpsons - Bart vs the Space Mutants</name>
		<desc>Bart vs. The Space Mutants is a platform game where the player goes into the role of Bart Simpson (from the TV show The Simpsons) and must stop the Space Mutants from invading Springfield.

On each of the five levels, Bart must collect (or get rid of) the ingredients that the Space Mutants are planning to use to build their machine, such as purple objects or balloons. He also has to collect enough "proof" of the aliens existence (brown coins left behind when they are jumped on), so his family members will help him when he meets a boss (characters such as Nelson and Sideshow Bob). This won't be easy since the Space Mutants are "using" human bodies as disguise. In order to discover who are the real Space Mutants, Bart must use his X-ray Specs.

The ways Bart can get rid of those objects sought by the Space Mutants are numerous. For instance, in the first stage, Bart must get rid of purple objects. He can dye them red, cover them, wash them, etc. Some even involve a little puzzle solving, like playing a trick on Moe to make him get out of the bar.

Bart also has some coins that can be used in many ways throughout the game, like buying things, getting devices operating, etc. Those coins are essential to solve some puzzles in the game.

		<name>Prohibition</name>
		<desc>Prohibition is a shoot'em up taking place in New York in 1930. The town is overrun by gangsters and you're hired by the police to rid the town of them.

The gameplay is simple: you're facing a row of buildings, a gangster pops up and you have to shoot him before the on-screen timer goes empty and he shoots you first. You can hide until the timer restarts but this is limited too. 
At the end of each stage is a bonus round where you have to shoot gangsters in a room, with no more ability to hide and a faster timer.
As you progress through each stage, the game will become faster, and enemies will become harder to find and to hit.
Of course, your goal is to reach the end of the game with the highest possible score.

		<name>Thunderbirds</name>
		<desc>International Rescue is made up of George Tracy, Brains Hackenback, and Tracy's five sons, each of whom has a Thunderbird craft of their own. They have four missions to complete in turn.

Each of these involves a two-man squad, whom you can switch between at any time. Each must select the correct objects to bring beforehand. You will have to move through the screens via lifts and ladders, avoid hazards and solve puzzles.

Mission one is set in a mine shaft, which is rapidly flooding and has two miners trapped. Next up is a nuclear submarine stranded after hitting a mine, which must be repaired and reactivated before it explodes. During this mission, you discover evidence of the miner's construction, so must break into a bank to steal the appropriate documents. This reveals that a madman is holding International Rescue to ransom, so you must finally travel to his lair to stop him.

Updates to the gameplay include an energy bar, which can be run down by either being hit from incoming fire or using a special weapon. The energy bar can be replenished by picking up power-ups, while special weapons (lightning, cyclones and waves) can knock down all fighters on the screen at the time.

		<name>Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde</name>
		<desc>Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde is a text adventure based on the famous novel by R. L. Stevenson. In this game you play the roll of Dr. Jekyll / Mr. Hyde. The year is 1868 and you are close to the completion of your work into the human psyche. The game starts in your drawing room the night before Dr. Jekyll creates the potion that will transform him into Mr. Hyde.

The Spectrum version of the game is divided into three parts (Dichotomies, Duality and Denouement) while the Atari version is just one long game. The goal of the first part is to mix up the portion that will transform you into Mr. Hyde. In part two Mr Hyde starts dominating over Dr. Jekyll and in the last part it is time to get rid of Mr. Hyde once and for all.

The Spectrum version was created using Professional Adventure Writer and the Atari version using STAC.

		<desc>This Green Beret-style arcade game follows the plot of the film starring Sylvester Stallone. As Stallone's Cobra character you must rescue Ingrid Knutsen before the Night Slasher gets to her. There are 3 levels of gameplay, set in a city, the countryside and a factory. All have multiple ledges and platforms to negotiate.

Cobra starts without a weapon, but he is tough enough to attack with a precisely timed head-butt, although this method of killing is risky, as it will kill Cobra if mistimed. Fortunately there are weapons to pick up along the way, by picking up hamburgers. The weapons include daggers, pistols and machine guns, but all are time-limited

Viewed from the side, there are many hazards to avoid along the way. Some of these include steps to jump over, tyres and hedges to plough through at maximum speed, and mud which will slow you down.

24 courses are built in, and you can choose a set of 5 of these to race at a time, or let the computer choose them at random. More importantly, a course designer allowing you to create one of your own is included, with full control of the placement of the many hazards..

		<name>Daley Thompson's Olympic Challenge</name>
		<desc>The third licensed game based around the legendary British decathlete did something slightly wider in scope than the basic Games style of play. Before you play the main events you have to train in the gym. Weight-lifting, squats and sit-ups are included, which involve waggling the joystick as fast as you can to fill a displayed bottle of Lucozade (clever bit of product-placement there). The better you do at this, the better you'll fare in the events, which are predominantly waggling-based as well. They include the standard decathlon events of running, jumping and throwing as well as you can. There are four types of shoes available, and choosing the wrong one for the event will seriously hamper your performance.

		<desc>With the scrolls now in his possession, The Last Ninja begins training a new order of Ninja. During a training session he is mysteriously transported to XXth-century New York. The Evil Shogun has returned! Torn from his own time, The Last Ninja must defend himself once more with nothing more than the belief in his own abilities. 

Last Ninja 2: Back with a Vengeance is an action/adventure game where the player, controlling a powerful ninja, must fight his way through opponents while collecting necessary items. The game is split into various levels, each of them depicting a different locale and divided into several screens. The view is isometric and the ninja can move in four different dimensions (he can also walk backwards) and jump. 

Enemies, armed with fists and various ninja weapons, wander around the levels. The ninja must fight them either bare-handed or with the weaponry he finds along the way; in either case, he has a number of blows and attacks at his disposal, as well as the ability to block. There's a special weapon, shuriken, which are thrown in a straight line rather than used for melee combat; if they strike an enemy, they'll instantly kill or at least heavily damage him. 

There are items scattered around the levels, such as keys, rope, a map or hamburgers (which restore health when eaten). Collecting these items and using them in a proper place is necessary for completing the game.

Most action takes place in isometric view, although there are some variations along the way to keep up interest. There are even some adventure-game elements, such as Indy's inventory which you can fill with various objects to use (i.e. money to buy things). They are mostly easy though, and are there only to relieve the tension from knuckle-blistering action.

Red Moon is an graphical interactive fiction game. Players assume the role of the wizard on his quest to recover the crystal. They will have the use of many weapons and a dozen magical spells. Combat is a key element of the game: both the magician and enemy opponents have hit points, in the style of RPGs.

		<name>Cosmic Sheriff</name>
		<desc>Cosmic Sheriff is a shoot 'm up game and you control Peter Jones, the Cosmic Sheriff who has to take out the rebels on a remote moon and shut down the pumps.

In the year 2023 the element cobalt has become an element of great strategic importance for the human race. The last deposit in the galaxy is on IO, the third moon of Jupiter. An extraction plant has been installed but has been sabotaged by rebels. The rebels placed pumps that will explode if their request is not agreed upon.

Orbital station TERRA-1 sends Peter Jones, the Cosmic Sheriff - controlled by the player - who is the best laser sniper of the galaxy. His mission is to deactivate the pumps and to end the saboteurs.

The station has three zones:

Zone 1. The warehouses

Zone 2. Computer and control Systems

Zone 3. The surface

Zone 1 consists of three levels and contains two pumps, zone 2 consist of 5 different levels and it is necessary to deactivate four pumps. Zone 3 consists of 9 levels and has 6 pumps that must be deactivated.
The pumps are always hidden behind doors, and Peter needs find and deactivate them before time runs out.
Locked doors can be opened by firing on them and contain a digital indicator on which you can read how many times you need to fire.

Beware, the base station is filled with all sorts of enemies. Aliens, called Maiketrons and the cause panic, invaders that carry laser guns. Androids, called Teeas. Tanks that equipped with revolving turrets. Mercenary soldiers from the planet Zorak called Lagartrones. They fight for the rebels.

		<name>Asterix and the Magic Cauldron</name>
		<desc>Goscinny and Uderzo’s cartoon characters are from the only Gaullish village in 50BC able to resist the Roman invasion. They can do this due to Getafix the druid’s magic potion, however the cauldron used to make this has been smashed into several pieces. Can brave Asterix and overweight Obelix find the pieces?

In this arcade adventure, it all comes down to you. The fifty screens you must explore take in your home village, a Roman encampment, and the forests in between. You have five pieces of wild boar, and these are used as you become hungry. 

Contact with wild boars or Roman soldiers triggers a one-on-one fight with punches and kicks. Defeating a boar earns you another piece of food, to restore energy once all lives are gone. Some sections are blocked until you collect their keys.

In the US version the character Asterix was replaced by a barbarian and the game's title was changed to Ardok the Barbarian.

There are also holes which can't be passed without a wheelbarrow to repair them, and regular earthquakes destroying parts of the paths.

		<name>Fat Worm Blows a Sparky</name>
		<desc>Fat Worm está trancado dentro da arquitetura de Spectrum, procurando por um disco de dados, para assim poder criar um clone de si mesmo, o qual ele presume que será capaz de "registrar uma vez" e "ler muitas vezes". Ele se move através dos chips, placas de processamento, com o objetivo de encontrar o caminho. Em sua jornada, ele encontrará bugs (do tipo insetóide) os quais deverão ser alvejados pela "blowing sparkie" - soltando uma bola de energia elétrica. Minas e tiros de impacto também podem ser disparados. O contato com esses bugs fará eles saltarem em sua direção, reduzindo gradualmente sua movimentação e obscurecendu sua energia. Você deverá coletar fusos para se livrar deles.</desc>

Your task is to guide them to safety through the complex isometrically viewed world (using the same basic game engine as Denton Designs' Great Escape license).

Hazards to be faced include the aforementioned dinosaurs and cavemen, as well as sea monsters, precarious mountainous ledges and dilapidated bridges. Objects including weapons and first aid kits can be collected. Each character has his own distinct behaviors - one becomes hungry easily, while another is only really competent while his fiancé survives. Although the ultimate aim is to save all four characters, you can continue while at least one is alive.

All fans jumped on his back and began to embrace, to kiss, to clear the clothes to him... just a little bit and had been the first film actor  attacked in public.

Humphrey finished in hospital with all kind of contusions and a nervous crisis that him left postrated in the bed during several months. When he recovered, he changed of house with the intention to obtain some privacy and to avoid that they took place more incidents like the one than took to the hospital.

But it seems that our friend was nothing lucky. The decorator had painted all the rooms with different colors that Humphrey had chosen and that caused certain alteration in his deranged nervous system.

A long time period passed and the dimension controlling force Doh has again come back to life. Occupying the huge starship Xorg, it has entered our universe from a different dimension. Mixtec, Arkanoid type spaceship, has lauched the craft Vaus II to make a preemptive attack on Xorg.

		<path>./Tir Na Nog (Europe).tzx</path>
		<name>Tir Na Nog</name>
		<desc>The first of a trilogy of similarly-designed titles from Gargoyle Games, Tir Na Nog is a complex mix of arcade and adventure elements done in an innovative way. The game is viewed from the side, and to change direction you must rotate the view.

You play Cuchulainn, and you must restore the Sidhe race to its former position of intelligence, enlightenment and civilization. This can be done by retrieving the four pieces of the Seal of Calum, which was shattered when the Great Enemy invaded.

Many puzzles are presented in the form of cryptic text messages (displayed in a neat pseudo-Celtic font), ranging form 'find my crown for a gift' to 'The backdoor key is me' - lateral thinking is required to interpret these messages. 

The action side of things is challenging, especially before you have found a good sword or mace. When you die, you return to the start of the game, but the settings of objects are left exactly as they were - making it important to regularly save the game, as it's possible to lose weaponry in a situation so precarious that you have little chance of retrieving it without suffering more combat.

The first task is to escape from a village, in which you are chained to a pole and awaiting sacrifice; once escaping the village you can continue your quest to find the gem. You must drink water to stay alive, and avoid enemies and pitfalls along the way.

Unlike the previous games in the series, The Eye of Bain has graphical representations of the room you are in. These are off by default and are activated by typing LOOK. You must then switch back to the actual input screen by pressing enter. As in the previous games in the series, the player uses simple verb/noun commands.

		<desc>In this platform game, you are a mere mortal who has been called by the Gods to defeat several mythological creatures that have been turned bad by the evil Dameron.

Myth: History in the Making is a platform game with a lot of fighting. The levels of this game deal with different mythologies, from ancient Greece to the Vikings, over to Valhalla (where none other than the hammer-wielding Thor awaits you), and more.

Apart from jumping from platform to platform, you'll also fight the enemies and bosses in your path with a variety of weapons - in the beginning you have only fists to defend yourself, but later you'll find more powerful weapons, such as swords and axes. There are many various types of enemies, different on every level. Typically, enemies keep appearing and coming at you from all sides, no matter how many of them you kill - so you have to keep moving. 

Some obstacles in the game require not only brute force, but also a bit of thinking and puzzle-solving (and guesswork) to get past.

While five members of the Enigma team: Zark, Sevrina, Syylk, Maul and yourself; escort Zoff to face the Emperor’s wrath, the war flares across the galaxy. As you cross the imperial border, Zoff concentrates his awesome psionic powers on the Enigma craft’s guidance system. Moments later the ship is bucking and burning through the atmosphere of a planet. You awake, head throbbing, to find the Enigma craft wrecked and General Zoff missing …

Gameplay is very similar to it's prequel Shadowfire. Take control of your four Enigma Force members, each with different abilities, and lead them through an underground complex filled with enemy soldiers and lots of puzzles. You will often need to combine the abilities of more the one crew member to solve a single puzzle. 

The user interface is completely icon-driven. Only character movement and shooting is done directly with joystick. The game is in realtime and you often need to switch between the characters because the enemy troops also move to through the complex and attack. So, gameplay can be very hectic, and the overall difficulity is very high.

Cast out from his village, stripped of his powers and spells and transformed into a hideously ugly parody of a human, he wandered the wastelands.

Slowly his powers began to return. He must return to his protectorate and recover his spells and reap his revenge on the evil that ruled where was once Kind Lord and Master. On the outskirts a page of his great book of spells blew into his weak grasp. "Hakumba". He cried and in a twinkling lifted into the air. Soon his powers might be restored and his wards rescued from the forces of the night...

Create spells by combining items you find in the environment and use them to locate and destroy the Skull of Doom.

Each of these involves a two-man squad, whom you can switch between at any time. Each must select the correct objects to bring beforehand. You will have to move through the screens via lifts and ladders, avoid hazards and solve puzzles.

Mission one is set in a mine shaft, which is rapidly flooding and has two miners trapped. Next up is a nuclear submarine stranded after hitting a mine, which must be repaired and reactivated before it explodes. During this mission, you discover evidence of the miner's construction, so must break into a bank to steal the appropriate documents. This reveals that a madman is holding International Rescue to ransom, so you must finally travel to his lair to stop him.

Seeking entertainment once in his life, your goal is to steal back your wages from your wife's purse and head off to the bright lights of the nearby casino (and other establishments) for a night of fun. Unfortunately, your axe-wielding maniac wife won't let things be that simple, and even escaping the house will be tricky without stumbling in the dark or waking the baby and alerting her to your sneaky plan. 

Mad Martha is primarily a standard text adventure game, however the user is also presented with the odd arcade section (such as collecting £'s of money whilst avoiding the family cat, or dodging frogger-style across a road to go back home and collect the car keys), to break up the game flow. Getting into the casino leads you to the final challenge.

		<desc>You are Smiffy, a person locked in the world of George Orwell's "1984." The book's totalitarian-spying concept is updated for the early-eighties, when the game was produced. Instead of humans monitoring other humans through the television screen, everything is controlled by a Central Computer. Smiffy decides to turn the computer off, and your adventure begins.

The game is a platform game.  In Orwell's book, gigantic buildings dominated the landscape, and whole worlds could be hidden inside them.  One of these buildings holds the Central Computer, and the game platforms are the corridors inside the building. You jump over monsters, duck flying objects, and work your way ever upward. Moving through the levels, you work toward the computer.

This game came out in 1983-84, when people were looking at Orwell's book, and seeing that his predictions were not perfect. Some felt that he had got his date wrong. This game plays on that idea, by moving the date back another ten years.

		<name>Chase H.Q. II - Special Criminal Investigations</name>
		<desc>Three girls have been reported missing including the mayor's daughter, and Chase Special Investigations has asked you to track down five vehicles, mentioned in the mission briefing, who are believed to be involved in the kidnapping. Using a heavy-designed machine with a V6 DOHC 3000CC Twin Turbo Engine, five sets of nitro-fuel boosts, and a gun attached to the steering wheel (which you can use to damage the target vehicle), your mission is to patrol the streets and find these vehicles.

The gameplay is similar to Chase H.Q., but there are a few differences. For example, cars travel in both directions instead of one, and some of them will catch up to your car and shoot at you. At least once in every stage a helicopter does a fly by and drops you some grenades you can use to further damage the target vehicle. A guy on a motorcycle will catch up to you and throw grenades at your car. And, most importantly, as mentioned earlier, you can shoot at the target vehicle rather than just bumping into it.

Have fun driving around, but remember, there is a strict time limit, so I wouldn't waste time or keep crashing into things if I were you.

Whack the food with your club and drag the food back to your cave before a dinosaur eats it – or you. But food alone is not enough for survival, you must also hunt cave-wives to secure your offspring. The procedure is the same here: hit the women with your club before they're eaten by a dinosaur, and drag them by their hair back to the cave. Your score is calculated according to how many seasons you've survived, how many wives and how much offspring you have.

		<name>Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde</name>
		<desc>Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde is a text adventure based on the famous novel by R. L. Stevenson. In this game you play the roll of Dr. Jekyll / Mr. Hyde. The year is 1868 and you are close to the completion of your work into the human psyche. The game starts in your drawing room the night before Dr. Jekyll creates the potion that will transform him into Mr. Hyde.

The Spectrum version of the game is divided into three parts (Dichotomies, Duality and Denouement) while the Atari version is just one long game. The goal of the first part is to mix up the portion that will transform you into Mr. Hyde. In part two Mr Hyde starts dominating over Dr. Jekyll and in the last part it is time to get rid of Mr. Hyde once and for all.

The Spectrum version was created using Professional Adventure Writer and the Atari version using STAC.

The game consists of 4 heavily defended canyons (turrets, spaceships, missiles etc.), and each canyon has a big guard alien at the end. Various pickup items exist for extra weapons, shields and fuel - running out of fuel loses the game immediately. At the end of each canyon level you briefly re-dock with your supply ship and receive extra fuel and shields. The game also includes a map editor, but that deliberately limits you to editing the first 3 levels. Levels can be saved/loaded via tape. AY/FM music is supported on 128K Spectrum models.

Before taking to the course you get a plan-view of the course, with the hazards lettered to indicate the order in which they must be taken.

There is a 100-second time limit on each course, with 20 penalty points resulting in disqualification. Hitting a hazard triggers a four-point penalty, while the horse refusing a jump leads to a three-point penalty - three of those means automatic disqualification. The action is side-viewed, with the horse rotated 30 degrees by pushing left or right, with timing the jumps crucial.

		<desc>Bob Holness hosted this fondly-remember quiz show, in which students competed to answer enough questions correctly to complete a run of answers across the board. This was the latest and most sophisticated computer version of the concept.

The exact mechanics of the game have been customized slightly. You start by choosing a question, which are all represented by the first letter of the answer. You must 'buzz in' by pressing your letter to input the answer (don't worry about exact spelling). If you get the question wrong, the computer chooses a square (seemingly with no strategy). In two player games each player has their own buzzer , and a correct answer sees you choose the next question. A digitized version of Bob's face reads out the questions - just be careful if you get any where the answer is 'organism'....

In the Commodore 64 and Amstrad CPC versions, ten teams are available, in the ZX Spectrum the selection is extended to the 24 participating teams.in the real World Cup. In any of the platforms, the competition is limited to eight teams. A training mode with juggling and penalty taking and saving is also included in all versions.

Each room is littered with moving sprites as well as lava pits and dangerous drops, all of which will drain the energy from Ted's single life.

Ted has 21 tasks to complete in this 8 1/2 hour-day, but it is largely up to him to find out what they are, and which order to do them in. The full day includes trips to the canteen, photocopier, power generator and the boss' office - logic will give you clues as to when these are to be accomplished.

He knows that solving one problem can change the nature of another, due to the program's advanced Event Processing. In each room, two flashing boxes must be hit, sometimes within a time limit, and Ted knows the location of the first few of these. On the technical side the game promises a full uninterrupted soundtrack and super-smooth animation.

As a novice Wizard you aim to earn enough points to become a top-level wizard and cast the spell which might blast the worlds apart. Unfortunately, the powerful wizards feel this is too dangerous, and will set out to stop you any way they can.

The gameplay resembles Gauntlet, as your wizard is viewed from above and shoots bolts of magic at enemies. There are in fact four control modes - the other three allow you to prepare more advanced spells, learn them by reading the books, and buy additional spells. Spells must be prepared in real-time, and miscasting a spell can have disastrous effects.

You are armed with guns, which can be used to slow opposing cars. During the races spanners can be collected, which are then cashed in for upgraded turbos, improved weaponry and engine upgrades. Hazards on the later tracks include ramps, bridges, buildings collapsing onto the track and barriers which open and close in a random sequence.

		<desc>Building on the basic gameplay and visual ideas of Ultimate's Atic Atac, Wizard's Lair stars explorer Pothole Pete, who is stuck in the Lair unless he can find all four pieces of the Golden Lion. The game is viewed slightly top-down, with indoor rooms bordered by line drawn vectors rather than the fuller jungle graphics.

The pace of the game is quite fast, and the challenge of the action elements is increased by not having infinite weaponry. The route through the game is non-linear, with multiple exits and secret rooms commonplace. Although the screens always contain a particular area, rather than the sections of different areas viewed in Atic Atac (which meant that you'd often have to work out how to reach some sections via other screens), a river is a central aspect of the layout, and delimits some sections of the screens.

Colonel K, head of a top secret department in which he does not know its names, sends Danger Mouse, along with his trusted assistant Penfold, to the Black Forest to destroy the Pi-beam, the Baron's secret weapon which poses a threat to world security. After DM says that it is an easy task, he and Penfold leave for Germany in their mousemobile. Unfortunately, finding the Pi-Beam would be difficult since the Baron has set many traps that DM needs to overcome. 

Danger Mouse in the Black Forest Chateau is an adventure game which involves the player reading a description of each scene, and choosing a number of options to proceed through to the next scene. The game is played in two parts. The second part cannot be played unless the first is completed since upon completion, the player is given a code to access the second part.

		<path>./Airborne Ranger (Europe).tzx</path>
		<name>Airborne Ranger</name>
		<desc>In this action/simulation game by Microprose the player takes the role of an U.S. Army airborne ranger. These Airborne rangers are dropped behind enemy lines by parachute to perform all kinds of dangerous missions. Gameplay consists of 3 phases:
Reading the mission briefing and outfitting 3 supply pods with machine gun ammo, time bombs, first-aid kits, grenades &amp; LAW rockets depending on this briefing.
2. Flying over the mission map in a V-22 Osprey plane to drop your 3 supply pods and parachuting out of the plane yourself.
3. Performing the actual missions and reaching the pick-up point before time runs out. There are 12 different missions which include capturing an enemy officer, blowing up an ammunition depot, photographing an experimental aircraft and liberating P.O.W.'s

Missions take place in either an arctic, desert or temperate setting. Using the mission map the player must decide the route towards the mission objective. This might require them to crawl through trenches, run around minefields or take out enemy soldiers and bunkers. Airborne Ranger was one of the first games with some missions that required a stealthy approach (staying undetected until a certain time, taking out a guard and stealing an enemy uniform etc.).

Airborne Ranger can be played in practice or veteran mode. In practice mode, gameplay is limited to a single mission, while in veteran mode, a series of missions or an entire campaign is played in order to earn medals &amp; promotions. All missions can be played on several difficulty levels.

		<desc>Set in the future, the object of Raster Runner is to guide your bike around the arena while trying to surround your opponent with the energy trail your bike leaves behind. Your opponent is doing the same. When one of the bikes crash, the player who took control a bike loses one life. A crash can be avoided by activating a force field, but only up to three can be activated. The player who loses all of their lives loses the game, while the other player wins. To assist you, a small overview map can be used to keep track of the bikes.

He does this by running around and turning on water valves to release the water into the pipes. Turning them off blocks the water from proceeding through the pipes. When Humpty waters enough flowers, he proceeds to the next level. The game ends when weeds outgrow the flowers.

		<name>Flunky</name>
		<desc>A Flunky is a male servant who must do routine jobs for his masters; in this game you are a Flunky and your masters are the British Royal Family. There are five tasks to be undertaken – light all the fires, fetching a toy boat from the bath for Prince Andrew, some freckles for Fergie, a wig for Diana, and a mystery task for the Queen. To gain access to each room, you need the signatures of particular royals along the way. 

Flunky is an arcade adventure using the same game system as other Don Priestley's Trapdoor license – large sprites overlaid onto block objects, seemingly designed around Spectrum attribute-clash issues. Many screens operate on more than 1 horizontal plane, so you can move your character in and out of the screens as well as across them. Guards will shoot at you if you attempt to access restricted areas, so be careful.

First up you must collect the stock to be placed on the shelves, then move it to the appropriate part of the supermarket. Over 30 foods are featured, ranging from bread and milk to eggs and carrots. Each section of the supermarket has its own isometrically-viewed screen. The shoppers are there to get in your way, and other hazards include vandalising kids, un-house-trained dogs and moronic shoppers who don't take their item off the top of the shelves. The ultimate aim of the game is to do so well that you can take over as manager.

		<name>The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole</name>
		<desc>Sue Townsend created a phenomenon in the mid-1980s, essentially incorporating lots of sharp satire and observational humour into the diary of a confused teenager. It might sound like an odd idea for a computer game, but Level 9 felt that there was an adventure in there.

Most of the major characters from the book appear, including Adrian's warring parents and their respective flings, his sweetheart Pandora, his best mate Nigel, school bully Barry Kent, and curmudgeonly pensioner Bert Baxter. The game didn't use many typed commands. You would read passages of text (many of them from the book) and be given 3 choices as to what to do, which would lead to other events unfolding. Your aim throughout all of this was to make Adrian as popular as possible.

Now all you've got to do is get it back into the Headmasters's safe!

Back to Skool follows the same gameplay style as its predecessor, but this time the school is bigger (there's a girl's section to explore) and there's a larger cast of characters. There's also more to do this time around, with more objectives to complete before you can finish the game.

		<desc>The first port of the popular arcade game Dragon's Lair to a home computer, featuring the infamous Dirk the Daring.

The game, as one would expect from the long-running Dragon's Lair series, has mixed gameplay, including platform, puzzle and arcade (in the old-fashioned choose-your-path sort of way).

This first port includes two adventures: the first is to raid the lair of Singe the Dragon (hence the classic name) and rescuing Princess Daphne, and the second, in a sort of instant sequel of the first chapter, features Dirk trying to escape from the castle, now overrun by the Lizard King and its minions.

He sends you into the castle of Spiteland, which is overloading with treasures to uncover. Whether you return with them to please the King, or simply flee with everything you can get, is up to you.

Either way, the gameplay is platform-based, with enemies floating around to rob you of energy on contact. There are also scrolling mazes to move through. As you collect objects (often by using some of the other items you collect, to create chemical reactions of sorts and adding an element of lateral thinking), you must try to trade them for the most valuable items you can get.

		<name>Geoff Capes Strongman</name>
		<desc>At a time when multi-event sports simulations where all the rage, Martech produced one licensed by a successful shot-putter and strongman. There are six events on offer, which represent standard strongman tasks such as truck-pulling, a tug of war and wrestling. Each must be completed within a time limit; points are awarded based on how much time is left.

The game's control method and design philosophy distinguishes between each of the 8 main muscles Geoff uses. After a joystick-waggling challenge to raise as much strength as possible, you can choose which muscles to assign it to, which adds an element of strategy and memory-testing.

During each event, the 8 muscles are displayed on either side of the screen, and as one comes into use it will flash. Controlling a cursor, you must click on this as quickly as possible to achieve maximum effect. Any energy unused on each muscle is kept over for future events.

As an evil warlord has enslaved your people, courtesy of his many henchmen and mercenaries, you will need them as you journey to his mountainous hideout to destroy him.

The game is no longer a single screen sequence of Yie Ar Kung Fu style duels, but is more influenced by Renegade, although with strict martial arts moves. However, a combat practice program is also provided, which plays much more similarly to the original game. The action takes place on different levels, which are reached by traversing ladders. There are many doorways to walk through, which cause a switch in the usually-scrolling display.

		<name>Puzznic</name>
		<desc>The challenge in each level of Puzznic is to maneuvre a selection of blocks into place so as to clear them all, by making them make contact with blocks of the same design. You control a cross-hair, which can move a block left or right, which can cause it to fall if there is no block under the space it would occupy.

There are many complications in terms of solving the levels. Moving platforms meaning that you need to move a block at a particular time, or in particular order, to prevent them being blockaded. In some situations there are an odd number of a certain type of block - solving these requires positioning two of the blocks one space apart, such that a move will result in a piece making contact with 2 others, and immediately removing all 3. You will also encounter blocks positioned on platforms suspended in space and gaps in level arrangements meaning that a certain number of blocks must be in place to make a certain move possible (by forming a stack, for example)

The game structure is slightly unusual, as after you complete each batch of four levels you get a choice of 2 sets of levels - you are progressing through an expanding matrix of levels, which means there are 2 sets on level 2, 3 on level 3, 4 on level 4, and so on. This means that there are a total of 220 screens in the game. Each screen is played against a time limit, and losing a level (either by running out of time, or by making a poor move and leaving an impossible position) loses one of your 3 lives.

The ingredients are all located in underground buildings, each of which can only be entered once you've found the appropriate key. The keys are located overground, and you must fly around on your broom to collect them.

The overground sections play like standard shoot 'em ups, as your broom is not affected by gravity and can fire bullets using your magic energy. Bats, fireballs and even seagulls are among the many creatures trying to stop you - contact will cost you more energy than shooting at them would. There are energy recharges on offer.

Once you go underground, the gameplay becomes a test of precision platform jumping, including some Manic Miner-esque blind jumps. The six underground sections can be completed in a variety of orders, but you will sometimes reach points that cna't be completed without objects from other sections, so a lot of back-tracking is required. Although you start with nine lives, they won't last all that long at first.

		<desc>Fight as either Red Beard or One Eye through various pirate themed levels, like ships and forts, and even some non-pirate themed levels, battling ninjas, skeletons, and others in a quest to get back your hard earned money from an evil wizard. You can also fight side by side with a friend (who controls the pirate you didn't choose).

Fighting works like fencing, with a few different moves to use, including parrying. The levels scroll through with a boss at the end of each. You gain money by vanquishing foes and digging for treasure where X marks the spot.

The contest is played out over 4 rounds, each of which ends with a fight with a proven champion. The Indian Cobra for 300 points, a war unit for 400, and a Russian Master for 500 are the first 3 big challenges. Eventually you must beat Zerwin the Magician to take the ultimate title of Oriental Hero. The usual range of moves are on offer, with kicks and punches rather than fireball special moves.

While the kick has a slightly longer range, the punch is a little faster. To gain an advantage over the enemies, it is possible to pick up various weapons including a machine-gun, throwing knives, or shurikens. Ammunition for all weapons is limited. Unlike many similar fighting games, there are no end-of-level bosses in the game.

		<name>Delta Charge</name>
		<desc>Delta is a horizontally scrolling shooter computer game originally released for the Commodore 64 by Thalamus Ltd in 1987. It was programmed by Stavros Fasoulas and the music was written by Rob Hubbard. The menu-music is based on the theme of Koyaanisqatsi by Philip Glass and the in-game-music is based on Pink Floyd's On the Run. The game was also released for the ZX Spectrum in 1990 as Delta Charge.

The game was released as Delta Patrol in the United States by Electronic Arts for its Amazing Software line of action-oriented software programs, in 1987 on the Commodore 64.[1]

The player controls a spaceship and gains power-up points by destroying formations of enemies. Some enemy formations instead subtract power-up points for the player, so the player must take note of which formations to destroy. Periodically blocks containing the power-ups (higher speed, faster rate of fire) appear and the player can pick one of them up: The more points the player has collected, the more powerful are the power-ups that can be chosen. Unavailable power-ups are gray and kill the player if he flies into them, making them part of the obstacles in the game. The effects of the power-ups are lost over time and must therefore be regained. The player gets a choice between in-game music or in-game sound effects. There is also a high score table but no way to save it when the game is turned off.

The game title music was covered by Desert Planet in their 2003 album Joystick Pop.</desc>

		<desc>Back to the Future II is a collection of five arcade and puzzle games.

Based on the second installment of the popular Hollywood series Back to the Future, this movie conversion has Marty McFly and Doc Brown travel through time to stop their arch-rival Biff from changing the future. The game consists of five parts, each inspired by one of the movie's most memorable scenes:

1. Hoverboard Chase: A Paperboy clone without newspapers, but with isometric levels and lots of enemies to dodge.
2. Jennifer Rescue: Guide Marty's girlfriend Jennifer out of the house without her meeting one of the four family members. Open and close doors to make the persons go from one room to the next in this top-down puzzle sequence.
3. Beat Biff: A side-scrolling beat-em-up sequence in the tradition of Double Dragon. Fight your way through a grim 1985 by jumping, hitting and kicking at Biff's lackeys.
4. Band Puzzle: Rearrange the mixed-up parts of an animated picture of the school band in this sliding block puzzle. The clock is ticking.
5. Hoverboard Chase 2: Another hoverboard sequence, similar to the first one, only this time set in 1955.

As well as his lady Wilma, his mates Tom, Dick and Harry come under your control as well, and you have to indirectly guide Wally's son Herbert. You've discovered a safe, but need to find the five parts of the code - each character is searching for a particular one. Their respective professions dictate which tasks they can perform - plumbing, electrical work and car maintenance for example. Objects must be collected and manipulated to accomplish all this. There are plenty of reaction and timing tests along the way, as well as hidden games.

		<path>./Jewels of Darkness Trilogy II - Adventure Quest (Europe).tzx</path>
		<name>Quest Adventure</name>
		<desc>The sequel to Colossal Adventure is an interactive fiction game with a VERB NOUN interface. 

The fantasy setting takes a clear influence from Lord of the Rings. After centuries of harmony, Middle Earth has hit problems due to a cataclysmic sequence of events - a crop failure leading to animals turning violent, and then an attack from a mysterious enemy to the north. The evil Demon Lord Alagiarept is discovered to be responsible, and as such the Wizards are given a week to beat him, before Middle Earth must surrender.

You play a rookie magician with Meditation, Mysticism and
Moneymaking skills. While the main war goes on, you attempt a much bolder mission - locate the four Stones-of-the-Elements and the Medallion of Life to enter Alagiarept's Dark Tower and kill him.

Your quest will take you through Beaches, Moors and Rocky Outcrops, as well as more specific locations such as the Pillar in the Desert, the Cave of the Sun-Dial and the Mills of God. Wolves, skeletal hands, sharks and octopuses must be dealt with.

		<name>Deactivators</name>
		<desc>Deactivators is an arcade-puzzle maze game which puts you in control of a squad of bomb disposal droids. You must pick them up and quickly throw them out of the building to safety - failure to do this costs you a droid and a room (occasionally blocking off other essential rooms). The game's levels have grid-like arrangements with doors, trapdoors and poles, and increase in size as the game goes on. For both these reasons, mapping is essential.

Security droids are on patrol, but these can be tricked into falling down holes. A computer room is the hub of your activities - this allows you to use teleports and turn off force fields, via the appropriate circuit boards which are hidden throughout the levels. On later levels the gravity isn't constant and you will find rooms with distorted directional senses, increasing the precision required significantly.

The control method is unusual, in that the accelerator and the throttle are controlled in combination - releasing the throttle while at the current gear's highest speed will move you up to the next one of the 8 gears. The brake turns into reverse when you reach zero velocity.

The game has 24 circuits, and points are awarded 7-4-2-1 for each of these, with the championship going to the driver with the most points by the end. Before each race there is a 3-minute qualifying session, in which you lap continuously with the aim of getting the fastest lap.

He must navigate his way through 24 platform screens (in a predefined order on the Spectrum but in any order on the Amstrad), collecting every object on each one to reveal the exit within a time limit. 

There are enemies on fixed attack paths to avoid - Lancelot has no weapon but can jump, and survive any length of fall. Avoiding contact is thus a case of jumping out of their way, and using lower ledges to strategically time his moves. There are sections you can freely climb but not descend, so timing and forward planning are important. Contact with any of these costs one of your four lives, and resets the screen to its starting position.

It is a video adventure technologically almost identical to Goody (also Opera's) but this game has a more complex map and an obligation to alternate among three weapons and a pole that you have from the beginning of the game.

The name of the game indicates a tour around each of the searches of David Livingstone that carry out the journalist Henry Morton Stanley in Africa in the XIX century. There the resemblance to reality ends, and turns into a platform game.

		<desc>A mad professor has kidnapped the President, and the ransom note says he plans to turn him into a war-mongering maniac (shouldn't be too difficult as I write this....). As Agent X, you must rescue him before he can be brainwashed.

The game is multi-section, and loads in a number of parts (as they are too big to all fit in the memory together), unusually for a budget-price release . The first section involves driving along a diagonally-scrolling road, attempting to ram various cars and trucks into holes, while avoiding them yourself. Later on you must negotiate shooting galleries and Green Beret-esque beat 'em up sections.

		<path>./Batty (Europe).tzx</path>
		<name>Batty</name>
		<desc>Batty is influenced by Arkanoid's method of reviving the Breakout phenomenon. You control a paddle at the bottom of the screen, with the top half of the screen containing an arrangement of bricks, most of which can be destroyed. You must move the paddle left and right so as to make contact with a ball, and thus deflect it (using the walls at the sides strategically) into the bricks, some of which require multiple hits to destroy. Wipe the destructible bricks out, and you move on to the next level; fail to keep the ball in play and you lose one of your 5 lives.

Some destroyed bricks release power-up tokens, which must be 'caught' with the bat as they fall. Functions include multi-ball, a larger paddle, and the ability to 'catch' and relaunch the ball each time, which makes it a lot easier to gain access to precise bricks or areas.

Batty also has enemies flying around and dropping bombs towards you - the bombs cause your bat to stick for a second, perhaps costing a life. Many levels contain magnets at the top of the screen, which make the ball's path harder to predict. The two player mode gives each player access to half the playfield, so co-operation is required.

		<desc>The third game in the OutRun series, which revolutionised the third-person perspective style of racing games. The levels are set across Europe, as you bid to escape from the police. Unlike in the predecessors, you use a different vehicle on each level, with motorbikes and jet-skis adding variety and taking different skill to use. You must complete each level within the strict time limits, and the roads are dogged with other cars to avoid and overtake. You can choose between sound effects or music.

		<desc>Magic Knight's second game (after Finders Keepers) sees him travelling through time to rescue 8 people including his tutor Gimbal, who have become locked in time thanks to a faulty spell.

The game invented a whole new control system, essentially pioneering the use of icons and windows in adventure games. You control a pointing finger, which can be moved onto each of the menus to reveal sub-menus, which contain the main options for object manipulation. 

All objects can be examined in detail, which produces a visual display of them, and possible clues as to their usage. You must look after your character's health and energy levels - carrying too many objects will progressively weaken him. You must also look after and direct the trapped characters once you locate them.

		<name>Micro Scrabble</name>
		<desc>Computer Scrabble is the earliest official computer version of the popular word game. The game has an 11000-word dictionary containing the most frequently-used words in Scrabble. As a result, some very obscure words (mostly of 2 and 3 letters - keen Scrabble players will know that these are often the most profitable scoring method) are included, but common words such as 'bigot' and 'sheen' are queried by the game - simply tell it that your move is a word and it will move on trustingly.

Inputting words is done by moving the cursor across or down to the starting position of the word, and then pressing to key the word in, pressing space before the letter you wish to use a blank tile as. All words formed are accurately scored. The game can juggle your tiles and allow you to manually rearrange them, and you can watch the computer 'think' as it notices possible moves and their scoring. There are four difficulty levels, with the highest capable of combined scores over 700.

		<desc>Ricky Steel is a feared renegade with a mechanical arm to fire bullets, and his Class A101 armoured yet amphibious Nightwind car is Stainless. He lives in a Mad Max-inspired world, but Dr. Vardos has sent a horde of androids to destroy it. Take control of Steel and stop this, in this Spy Hunter-style vertically scrolling road-based shooter. 

The game is split into four sections. You begin on foot, and must travel up the screen to reach the Nightwind. Helicopters and other foes must be shot or avoided, and their bullets avoided. You then enter your vehicle and drive up the screen, dealing with similar hazards. The controls involve pushing forward to accelerate and pushing down to reverse. Level 2 involves taking to the water, attacking submarines using bombs. The final showdown involves hunting down and killing Vardos, despite the attentions of animal-shaped asteroids and other hazards.

The scanner along the bottom of the screen is crucial to spotting foes as they approach. You have a limited shield, turned on and off by pressing space, and limited fuel which is recharged by collecting fuel circles which float by.

Most instructions are either 90-degree compass moves, or VERB NOUN commands such as GET PAINTING, FIT CHAIN and CLIMB TREE. On the player's journey he will discover treasures, which must be stored in a special room, reached via a spell. 

Around this time, the Mysterious Adventures game engine was redone to allow complete sentences, instead of the 2-word Scott Adams parser that had been used previously.

Grumpy Gumphrey Supersleuth is made up of 39 screens of puzzles. Each room is viewed in forced-perspective 3D, and the perspective of a room is not always the same as the perspective you entered it – however the initial movement into the main space of the room is automated. A task is dictated to you at the base of the screen, with instruction on where to find the objects you need. Watch out for an umbrella, keys and a skateboard among other things. You can hold multiple objects, cycling through them with the 'S' key.

Swimming involves moving left and right as fast as possible, while pressing fire when a breath is required. Skeet shooting and archery both come down to timing - though elevation and wind factors affect the latter. Gymnastics involves timing a succession of presses to ensure that the jump is long and the landing graceful. The triple jump involves one press for each part of the jump, whereas the weightlifting involves merely brute strength.

Gameplay is a fairly conventional platform shoot 'em up with maze elements. Your weapon is powerful enough to destroy Ironside's forces, but needs to be recharged regularly. Hazards to be avoided include laser bolts, falling crushers and gas and electric discharges.

		<desc>You take on the role of Dastardly and Mutley from the Hanna-Barbera cartoon series in this action title with superficial racing overtones. Your aim is to complete each course in a particular position, which is achieved either by waiting for them to suffer enough damage to drop out of the race, or by inflicting that damage yourself. Your car is armed with a forward-shooting arrow to impale the opposition cars, and deal with the many hazards the races throw at you, including boulders and rabbits, which can be taken out for points. 

The action is viewed from the side, scrolling horizontally as you progress, and vertically when you need to jump or duck over the bigger hazards, which must be avoided Moon Patrol style, meaning that you must often time one jump properly so as to be able to make the next one successfully. In some sections of the road you can duck down onto another set of roads, which may or may not be less hazardous. Falling into thin air costs you a life, while heavy impacts deduct some of your energy points. When the view doesn’t show the next section, and the correct course is not clear, an arrow appears to direct you.

If needed, the player can refuel, buy water or whatever else is required from the powerboats in Europe or the tankers in Africa. Prices of these essential materials aren't always very reasonable, given the player's meagre starting wallet, motivating players to earn higher sponsorships through strong performance in the race.

There are three different stages: one in Europe, another one in the desert of the Sahara, and finally a crossing of the Tenere desert before arriving in Dakar.

		<desc>This game consists in directing an explorer through a gigantic map in the search of four coffee coats which are distributed on it. In the territory where the action takes place we can find rivers, fences, trees, rocks and some more things which can suppose an obstacle for accomplishing the mission. All that together with the presence of killer indigenous serpents which will try to finish with us.

The map has 100 screens that we must cross if we want to find the four coats. Nevertheless, it's necessary to consider that at least one of them is always located inside the cave, which we will only be able to open if previously we found the key. There are also many objects distributed on the way that can help us: boats to cross rivers, tips to break rocks, machetes to cut to the vegetation, etc.

		<name>2 Player Soccer Squad</name>
		<desc>Most football management games written for 64K/48K computers concentrated their memory space on providing as many features as possible for a lone player. As the title implies, this game is an exception - 2 players each take control of a club, taking it in turns to make their managerial decisions and play their matches. For an extra competitive edge, they can include their own name among the players (which are otherwise made up of the real players of the day).

The game uses a fictional 20-team superleague, with English and Scottish clubs, as well as a knock-out cup. You can buy or sell players, who have ability ratings out of 15, and swap your squad of 19 around to choose 11 starters plus 2 substitutes. Match scores are listed along with goalscorers, although the scorers update more quickly than the scores. You are kept up to date with financial changes after each match.

		<name>MASK III - Venom Strikes Back</name>
		<desc>VENOM Strikes Back is a single player side scrolling, two dimensional, shoot-em-up. It is the third game to be based on the popular MASK comics, TV series, and books of the mid 1980's.

The M.A.S.K., Mobile Armored Strike Kommand, organisation led by Matt Trakker, are battling the criminal organization known as V.E.N.O.M., Vicious Evil Network of Mayhem. Combat in the previous two games has been based around the transformer like vehicles used by M.A.S.K., not so in this game.
In this game Matt's son has been kidnapped by V.E.N.O.M. and has been taken to the moon. Matt has been given an ultimatum, disband M.A.S.K. and leave the world at the mercy of V.E.N.O.M., or never see his son alive again.

Matt sets out for the moon where he must overcome the defences of V.E.N.O.M.'s base, rescue his son and steal a rocket back to earth. 
In his quest he is helped by special masks that give him special powers. For example one mask will give Matt the ability to shoot bullets others will allow him to fly, pass through solid objects, float across bodies of water, have temporary invulnerability and so on. However, Matt can only carry four masks and can only use one mask at a time. Each mask has just 99 units of energy, or bullets, and this number is reduced each time the mask is used so eventually the mask will need replacing.

At the end of each level as Matt progresses to the next the player gets a code word. This codeword can be typed in when the game is re-loaded allowing the player to restart at the new level.

		<name>Bobsleigh</name>
		<desc>Ever wanted to go to the Winter Olympics? If you've always wanted to operate a bobsleigh team and even participate in the races, then this is the game for you.

The game starts off with the management side of things including training the team, buying equipment, and keeping those finances from the red. If you go bankrupt then it's game over. Going bankrupt can happen from spending too much money, crashing, or poor finishes.

When you start the race or season then it's time to start racing. The game is viewed from inside the bob behind the driver and brakeman. You steer the bob left and right (gravity controls the speed) as you watch the track hurtling towards you. You can see your speed and times as well.

Do well and you receive more money. This can go towards more training and better equipment.

Good luck for the season and hopefully you can get to the Olympics. Your gonna need all the luck in the world.</desc>

		<desc>"Basket Master" é um jogo de basquete um-a-um do principal desenvolvedor espanhol: Dinamic Soft, dedicado ao jogador da NBA Fernando Martín, o primeiro espanhol (e o primeiro aluno não europeu de uma universidade dos EUA) a jogar na NBA, que tragicamente morreu 3 anos depois em um acidente de trânsito aos 28 anos.

O foco aqui está na ação pura e não adulterada: basta escolher um jogo para um ou dois jogadores e pronto - você estará em uma quadra da CGA tentando marcar pontos. Embora o nível de dificuldade possa ser alternado ("amador" ou "NBA").

O Basket Master era originalmente para computadores de 8 bits, plataformas estas que surgiram em dezembro de 1986 após vários atrasos.</desc>

		<desc>In Realtime's previous Starstrike game (not to be confused with Star Strike), the evil Outsiders attacked the Federation and had to be forced back. This time, the boot's on the other foot, as the Federation have sent their Starstrike II vehicles in to take them out. Armed with sophisticated computers, lasers and shields, all it needs is a good pilot, such as yourself.

Twenty-two planets fall under Outsiders control, and each has grid-based defenses which must be taken out, complete with all their command computers and production droids. The planets are split into five groups, each of which can be chosen at the start of the game. 

The combat is intense, and aims to create the likely feel of space combat, with lots of ducking and weaving to set up shots. The game features filled-in graphics, unlike the Elite-esque wireframes of the first game.

		<desc>You play Rick Dangerous, an Indiana Jones type who's on a quest to find the lost Coolu Amazon tribe.  However, his plane crashes in the middle of a bunch of crazed Coolus. Hopefully he's up to the challenge of escaping. If he is, he will find himself in the pyramid of Egypt with no easy way past leaders and their minions, and then engulfed in a web of traps in a Nazi base.

Rick Dangerous is a platform game across over 100 screens, in which Rick has his gun in one hand, and dynamite sticks in another. You must take a methodical approach to clearing each screen, as there are traps in place which will need memorizing and preempting where possible. Use the dynamite wisely, for enemies you can't get into the purely-horizontal range of your gun.

While searching it, he eventually finds an escape shuttle sitting in the launch bay, only to discover that it is out of fuel. He returns to the satellite in an attempt to find some.

The fuel cans are scattered around the five levels of the ship, which Dan can get to by using the Mekon's teleporters. To get to them though, Dan needs to destroy any Treen that gets in his way using a variety of weapons, brought by using a computer terminal. Along the way, the Mekon leader can be seen sitting around, and destroying him will more often than not reward Dan with a pod that he needs to access the teleporter. Dan can use his jet-pack to navigate the satellite, but this will eventually run out of fuel.

Moreover, MOT has the bad habits of hiding in your cupboard, smashing all the furniture in your house from time to time or eating all the food in your fridge during the night.
And of course,  when you tried to explain to your parents that it wasn't you but MOT who crushed their car, they sent you to a psychiatrist.

But MOT is your friend, and you wouldn't let him down when he calls for your help, would you ?

All the power of Gremla rested in the almost religious fidelity of her lieutenant Arkos; nevertheless, the intelligence of this Mega-Terminator of battle had evolved on the last ultraguarks in such a way that, finally, he left Gremla and he was united to the troops of the sidereal infantry, who commanded the general of the blue star Mc Killer.

As far as the game in itself, it's frenetic arcade divided in two parts, in which when it stops to arrive at second, you needed a key access that you obtained at the end of first.

		<desc>The witch Circe imprisoned twelve virgins for a ritual sacrifice. Ulysses, the Greek hero, recently washed away on the beach after a storm destroyed his ship and its crew, is summoned by the populace to rescue the kidnapped women. In exchange, they promise to help him return to Itaca, his home. To aid in his quest, he receives from a wise elder a magical hammer.

Ulises is a side-scrolling platform game from Spain. Although Spanish, the game has almost no text, only four words: "Opera Soft", the name of the company; "Ulises", the spanish name of the character, and the word "Fin" at the end (spanish for "The End"). The Ulysses character moves from left to right throwing hammers to kill an incessant wave of enemies. The game doesn't have levels, but sections within one expansive level. Precise jumps are required to clear abysses and gorges, and to avoid collision with dangerous objects. The SPACE bar makes the character throw the hammer forward. O and P move Ulysses left or right, respectively. Q is the jump/move up button, and A is the crouch/move down button. The game starts with three lives, and each rescued damsel adds an extra one. There isn't any form of saving progress.

		<desc>In the game you play Hen House Harry who has to collect 12 (a dozen) eggs from each level, while avoiding the ducklings.  The levels each occupy a single screen, and are made up of platforms, ladders and lifts (or elevators), and are thus similar to those in classic platform game Donkey Kong.  Corn can also be collected, which stops the time limit from ticking down and also stops the bonus, collected when the level is completed, from decreasing.  The ducklings also eat the corn, however.

There are only 8 distinct levels.  The ninth level is a copy of level 1, the tenth is a copy of level 2, and so on.  However, on the second time around the ducklings that can use the platforms and ladders are replaced by the Mother Duck, who can fly around the level going through the platforms and ladders.  On the third time around, you have to face both the Mother Duck and the ducklings, and similarly on subsequent goes round, when there are more ducklings.

League and cup tournaments are included, as are single matches and set-piece practice sections (you have full control of these). The gameplay involves a number of advanced moves, and includes a gauge to control the exact dimensions of a kick (height and curl as well as strength), if you can use it quickly enough. Unusually, you have control over the goalkeeper, so can only blame yourself when you concede a goal. The players each have their own skills and strengths, and these develop as the game goes on – if you play well, your players become better, and more capable of facing better opposition.

Once the rivets are removed from the final level, Donkey Kong falls, and the two lovers are reunited.  From there, the levels start over at a higher difficulty.

Along the way, Mario must dodge a constant stream of barrels, "living" fireballs, and spring-weights.  Although not as powerful as in other future games, Mario can find a hammer which allows him to destroy the barrels and fireballs for a limited amount of time.  Additionally, Mario can also find Pauline's hat, purse and umbrella for additional bonus points.

Donkey Kong is also notable for being one of the first complete narratives in video game form, told through simplistic cut scenes that advance the story.  It should also be noted that in versions of the game for early 1980's consoles, Donkey Kong only used 2-3 of the original levels, with the cement factory usually omitted.

Before you start a game you can select one or two players (The C64 version allows you to watch the computer play) and if you want a 10 ball or 15 ball game. When you play an actual game the whole table is shown on screen and is viewed from above. To take a shot you position a cross to where you want to hit the ball and when your happy with your position you hold down the fire button and a power bar grows. As the bar is growing you can adjust the spin of the ball. When the bar reaches the power you require you let go of the fire button.

		<desc>Robin was repairing the Batmobile when he was kidnapped. Before Batman can contemplate rescuing him, he must reassemble the car from its seven parts. There are all over the Batcave, in this isometric arcade adventure taking in over 150 screens. 

Initially Batman lacks his super powers, which must be collected. The Batbag allows you to pick up and drop objects, Jet Batboots allow you to jump, the Thruster allows Road-Runnering (movement while you fall), and the Low Gravity Batbelt keeps you in the air for longer.

Short-term bonuses of invincibility, extra energy, and extra life and an enhanced jump can be collected, but there is also one which neutralises all power-ups. You have eight lives, but each cluster of Batstones acts as a restart point - when it is game over you can return to that spot, with lives and equipment as they were.

Strike Force Cobra must penetrate his hideout, crack his computer codes, and rescue the scientists before any of this can be done. To crack the code you use a DLB (Digital Lock Breaker) which is more effective when more numbers have been found, and the scientists give these when rescued.

Your team of four members of varying nationalities is chosen from a pool of 8, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. The game is viewed isometrically, and you move the characters (one at a time) through the lair, shooting down intruders and clearing any traps for the other members to go through.

Joe Blade is viewed side-on and uses flick-screen progression. The bombs are deactivated by arranging letters into alphabetical order, but the bulk of the gameplay involves shooting and maze navigation. The screens are linked in various ways, and contain a number of keys which must be used correctly.

Escaping from the whole 10-level complex is a big task though, as each of the many compounds has its own locks. These can be removed using mirrors to guide a solar beam onto the locks, weakening them. There are patrol guards trying to stop you, and each time you fire a beam and it fails to open a door, you lose a life. The action is viewed from above with a pseudo-3D feel.

Each weapon offers its own advantages and must be used at certain times to overcome specific obstacles or opponents. 

The game's coin-op origins are evident in the fact that it does not have passwords or saves. To compensate for this, however, adjustable difficulty settings were added.

Walking on to a Beam Pad means that upon losing a life, you will resume from the screen on which you died. As enemies are dying, keep shooting at them to keep increasing your score.

There are power-ups to collect, through energy bubbles. Each weapon has 5 possible energy levels, and can only be used if you have enough. Collect a bubble when you weapon is at the top level and you will collect an improved weapon.

You control the detective with either directional (key or joystick press corresponds to motion) or rotational (forward to move, left or right to rotate) control. Pressing fire activates the main command menu, which allows you to pick up or drop objects, use your gun, and communicate with people. You can carry 3 items at a time; a command exists to swap between them.

It all takes place in a post-apocalyptic universe in which a lot of money can be earned by transporting goods form place to place, but the large gangs of Overlanders who already do this are keen to stop you.

Two missions are on offer at a time, one tougher but more lucrative than the other, with half the money paid upfront and the other half on successful completion. Before setting off, you can buy upgrades such as turbo chargers, armour and enhanced weapons, each of which has a limited lifespan. Attacks from other vehicles can come either from guns or attempting ramming, and the roads are poorly-maintained and hazardous, so be careful, or better yet be violent first.

As with the rest of the series, the game uses a largely visual system, in which a press of the fire button calls up a menu of options, such as 'examine', 'pick up' or 'cast spell. Selecting these calls up a sub-menu to choose what should be examined or thrown, which objects to combine, which spells to cast, and so on. The objects to be used include a chicken, a disguise and eggs. One new feature is that bolts of lightning are fired down at Magic Knight from the sky, and these must be avoided.

		<name>Jack and the Beanstalk</name>
		<desc>Jack and the Beanstalk has the player controlling Jack, a young boy determined to steal the giant's treasures. The game consists of four levels. In the first level, Jack must climb a beanstalk to the top while avoiding worms, spiders, and birds. Jack may obtain a weapon in this level and use it to kill them. In the second level, Jack climbs a series of brick walls while avoiding the same enemies, and collects the money bag at the top and leaves the screen in the upper-left. On level three, Jack climbs the fireplace to get to the golden goose in the cage, then climbs down a ladder to the bottom. Finally, level four has Jack climb up the giant to reach the table, where a huge money bag resides. The game ends when Jack completes his objective or when all of his lives are lost.

		<desc>Dick Tracy is a tie in to the 1990 movie adaptation of the classic comic strip, staring Warren Beatty and Madonna.
While an action/adventure hybrid using this license was released by Disney for the PC and Amiga, Titus also held a license to the movie.  This is a side scrolling action game, where you control Dick Tracy as he moves through five stages, shooting gangsters with an assortment of weapons.  Each stage leads to one of the mob bosses, until you ultimately capture the big man himself.

Unfortunately, searching for the eggs comes at a price. Ug must also leap across rivers, dodge erupting volcanoes, and use a number of rocks to kill any land-based predators that get in his way. If he comes into contact with any of these, he will lose some energy, which can be restored by collecting fruit. Once Ug has taken all three eggs to his cave, he has to collect some wheels so that he can travel to the next island.

		<name>Savage</name>
		<desc>Savage contains three different parts, each with its own style. You can play all three, but to get more than one life on levels 2 or 3, you must first input the code earned on completing the previous level.

You play Savage, a muscular warrior who was imprisoned in a castle. When he broke free, he found out that his imprisonment had been a trick with the sole purpose of imprisoning his love, the maiden. You have to progress through the 3 parts of the game to rescue her. 

The first is a simple horizontal-scrolling shooter, in which you use the trajectory of your shots to kill enemies and collect the treasures and improved weapons they drop when killed. The second is a 1st person perspective 3D shooter resembling Space Harrier, with skulls to shoot and monoliths to avoid. In the third you play Savage's Eagle form, flying through platform-style levels avoiding timing-based hazards and shooting anyone who gets in your way. In this section bubbles can be shot to release power-ups

		<name>Super Scramble Simulator</name>
		<desc>Super Scramble Simulator recreates the sport of scrambling/ motorcross, but in a manner similar to the Kikstart TV show and games. The basic aim is to ride a motocross bike through hazardous courses within the time limits.

The game uses a split-screen display, with a big window viewed from the side as well as a longer-range aerial view - the latter is useful for dodging hazards to the left or right, as the side-view doesn't demonstrate these accurately. The bike has 3 gears, and you must use a low gear to go uphill. You will need to do wheelies to ensure good landings from the big jumps, and to clear divots in the ground.

		<name>Formula One</name>
		<desc>Shortly after Football Manager became a sensation, the sports management concept was applied to the high-pressure dollar-intensive world of Formula 1 racing. The top six teams of the early 80s are featured (Ferrari, Williams, Renault and McLaren as well as the now-defunct Brabham and Lotus), and you can choose which one to manage. Your first tasks are to choose your two sponsors and two drivers, with all the day's top names as well as 6 'rookie' drivers, who are cheap, but there's no guarantee of getting a good one.

Once the game is properly underway, you must buy engine and chassis upgrades, and can improve the quality of your pitcrew - all of which eats into your budget. Your cars must be raceworthy to be able to race. After qualifying you must choose your tyres for each car - rain can be a factor, and the game informs you of the expected conditions before the race.

The races are depicted via a timing board which displays the top 6 in the order, images of the cars flashing by (with a distinction made as cars come into the pits), and messages detailing crashes, spins and technical problems. Your drivers can be called in for pitstops, which involves moving a man around to undo each tyre in sequence, which is hardly realistic but does add some arcade skill and variation.

The main bulk of the gameplay is a horizontally scrolling shoot ‘em up, putting you in control of Xain, who can jump or duck to avoid enemies and jump up to higher ledges. Lots of extra weaponry can be collected along the way, although this is lost when one of your five lives is lost.

The planets Lagto, Cleemans and Cleemalt are all available for selection immediately. These each have their own settings – Cleedos is desert, Cleemalt cavernous and Lagto lush and verdant. After completing each planet you must successfully fly to the next one.

The ship is viewed side-on in a platform-type perspective, and contains 20 holds, each of which is split across 8 screens of treasure. Once you have cleared each one, you have 45 seconds to escape the hold and prepare for the next one.

The levels all feature lots of doors, each of which has its own key to open it - these are numbered. As only one key can be held at a time (pick another up and the first one returns to its original location), and many of the enemies are located behind doors, a great deal of strategy as to which order you collect these in is required.

		<desc>Cult hero Matthew Smith followed up Manic Miner with a seminal platform game. Having struck it lucky in the first game, Willy now owns a lavish mansion with over 60 rooms linked in a 3D plane, and must tidy it all before his housekeeper will let him sleep.

Each room has its own hazards, such as spikes, revolving razors and ropes. The route through the house must be navigated carefully, due to the multiple entrances to some rooms - this is perhaps the first action game where mapping is an advantage. Another innovation, to the chagrin of players everywhere, is manual protection - a sheet of colour-coded numbers.

The game is set on the mean streets of Brooklyn, which you must venture through to meet your girlfriend, and then rescue her from her kidnappers. This is split into five levels, taking you through the subway and the docks as well as some inhospitable streets. A wide range of aggressive moves are on offer, including headbutts, kicks, punches and flying kicks. Much of the game's violence is depicted in a fairly tongue-in-cheek style, with an element of attempted humour along the way.

With either one or two players, you must move through a series of Gauntlet-style underground mazes, killing the bad guys and collecting health and other bonuses from flying saucers (underground? SLIGHT logic gap there, methinks).It's designed to be played co-operatively, although bullets from one player can harm the other.

The Xybots are out to stop you, of course, and many have advanced attack patterns as well as bullets to fire at you. Being able to view round corners is useful, allowing you to plan a strategy - often it's good to send one player forward and let the other play the waiting game, as in Gauntlet.

		<path>./Darius (Europe).tzx</path>
		<name>Darius</name>
		<desc>Darius was Taito's effort to compete in the arcades against the likes of R-Type and Gradius. Technically impressive, it featured three screens depicting the largest playfield seen in a game so far (the same system was employed for Ninja Warriors), with the player sitting atop a big set of loudspeakers. Visually and audibly, it was a league above Irem's and Konami's offerings.

When Taito (and others) ported the game to home machines, they were forced to shrink the playfield to fit in one single screen, and re-dubbed it Darius Plus.

The plot of Darius involves the two heroes Proco Jr. and Tiat Young fighting the menaces posed by galactic fish and other sea animals again their homeworld.

What sets Darius apart from other shoot'em-ups of the time is its way of letting the player choose his path with a certain amount of freedom. At the end of each area (level), you are able to choose between one of two worlds which the area branches into. This renders a higher replay value, since there are many paths to reach the end of the game by.
Apart from this, the gameplay is on the simplistic side, both due to unimaginative attack waves and little interaction with the surroundings, but mainly due to the very basic powerup system, which is nowhere near the complexity of the aforementioned R-Type's and Gradius'.

		<desc>Hawk Storm is a brave warrior living on the planet Edos, and its citizens look up to him for survival. Edos has only one source of energy: the giant capacitoid crystals, capable of storing energy by day and regenerate that energy during the icy cold nights. Having realized this, the evil Nevik warriors decided to steal all but two of these crystals, making it impossible to sustain normal life on the planet. As a result, all of the people are forced to go in a Life Suspension Program, except Hawk, who must recover all thirty-two stolen crystals if Edos is to survive.

The Neviks are scattered throughout Edos to make sure that Hawk does not succeed in his quest, but Hawk can collect up to three different weapons – shields, mines, and stryders – that can be used against them. Also scattered around are various hazards such as firepits, slimeballs, spikes, and gun turrets, which can cause Hawk to lose some energy if he collides into them. There are several objects which Hawk can use to his advantage. Energy pods can restore his energy, lifts can be used to reach higher platforms, and teleports can take him to different areas.

Você pode coletar uma armadura para proteção, armas aprimoradas (a unidade inicial dispara apenas horizontalmente) e uma scooter de alta velocidade - cada uma das quais dura as próximas três telas. Vidas extras podem ser coletadas durante o percurso.</desc>

		<desc>In a grim future, the people are kept under control by a horde of genetically-modified beings who look identical to everyone else, and appear to act the same, but are subtly controlling minds and actions. This works perfectly for Centro-Holographis until two of their droids, Hammerfist (male) and Metalisis (female) malfunction. They try to put things right, and come under your control in this side-view action game with adventure elements.

You can switch between the two characters at any moment, and must use this wisely as their abilities differ greatly. On each screen you must kill all enemies, as well as taking out the robots which keep the doors locked.

		<name>Scuba Kidz</name>
		<desc>Players take on the role of a scuba driver, and it is up to them to navigate a series of underwater caves in search of their kidnapped friends. While exploring these caves, their air supply depletes so they must go up to the surface to refuel on air. Finding an air tank enables players to swim underwater for a longer period of time. If players have no air left, the game is over. 

Useful items can be found scattered around the sea floor. These items include keys, which are used to unlock passages; bubble power, which allows players to trap creatures in bubbles which burst; extra speed; and monster suit, which scares off the creatures. Some passages are blocked by walls, and players must use their bubble power to destroy the wall.

Between caves, players have to destroy a shark which makes its way across the screen. If players make contact with the shark, their air supply diminishes. When the shark is destroyed, players proceed to the next cave. Later ones have less open surface, trickier passages, and faster creatures.

		<desc>The planet of New Texas is similar to the Wild West-era Texas - mystic Indians, bar-room brawlers and sharp-shooting mercenaries. The only man tough enough to keep order in such a place is Marshall Bravestarr. Stampede is the villain of the piece; he aims to bring the dead back to life as zombies for his own use.

BraveStarr is a side-scrolling action title based on the popular 80's space western cartoon series. Starting with a limited amount of time, you must find and rescue Shamen who was captured by the evil Tex Hex, to aid Stampede's plans. You get nine minutes to complete your task.

The game begins in Fort Kerium in front of the bar. You can enter buildings, to talk to people and examine rooms. Outside, you must jump around, shoot enemies and collect various power-ups they drop. Marshall BraveStarr has only one life - when he takes damage, he loses time instead of life energy.

		<desc>An impossible mission has fallen into the most improbable hands. Poor Nimrod is sent to rescue a few of his Biopton companions from the hands of the brutal Cratons, who have imprisoned them in a chain of prison planets collectively known as "The Matrix".

Nimrod must travel throughout the galaxy, infiltrate each planet where matrix activity is detected and rescue his friends. He may use the objects left at his disposal, such as TV cameras, which provide valuable intel about each complex, the ammo crates, which contain weapons needed to defeat the disruptors and guards, and the building blocks, which can be used as protection or to activate weight sensors.

At the same time, he must avoid, if possible, the armed guards, the disruptors, which will block his way, the mines and the black ice. Once Nimrod locates a hostage, he needs  to take him to the landing zone and extract him to his spaceship in order to complete the rescue.

"The final matrix" is an isometric arcade with adventure elements, such as puzzles and traps. A novelty feature is that every matrix can be entered at any time, following no particular order, which may appeal to casual players.

You, a sole survivor of the once elite 'time corps' have been chosen by the federation of law and order to combat the entity in three time zones: Ancient Greece, Dark Ages and Space.

The game, controlled by joystick, has you moving the time warrior in horizontal-scrolling parallax levels.
You have to collect nine pieces that assemble to a face of the primeval entity who must be battled.

Meanwhile, the locals in each time zone do not like time warriors and throw and fire everything at you. Luckily, you are carrying an energy conversion kit that changes some shot objects and enemies into valuable weapons and armoury.
Good luck, you will need it!

		<path>./Operation Thunderbolt (Europe).tzx</path>
		<name>Operation Thunderbolt</name>
		<desc>Operation Thunderbolt is the exciting sequel to Operation Wolf. An airliner is hijacked by terrorists en-route from Paris to Boston, who threaten to kill all hostages on board if their mates aren't released from jail. Instead of reaching its destination, the airliner makes a landing in Kalubya, Africa, and all the hostages are hidden in various locations. The authorities have asked the hero from Operation Wolf to rescue the hostages, but only this time, the hero brings his friend along for the ride.

There are eight missions to complete in Operation Thunderbolt, and each one has you shooting down soldiers, choppers, and tanks. The gameplay varies every one or two missions. In some missions, you are driving a jeep or controlling a boat, while in others, you are walking while you're shooting. You have a limited supply of ammo, and a limited supply of rocket bombs, but you can always stock up by shooting down crates falling from the sky, or by killing a cat or dog that get in the line of fire. Also from crates, you can get special items like bulletproof vests, rocket bombs, and different weapons.

You also have a life bar to worry about. If you're shot at by soldiers, or if rocket bombs or grenades are thrown at you, you 'll lose energy, and once you're energy is depleted,  you lose one of your three lives. You can lose a lot of energy by killing hostages on purpose,  and you can't easily avoid killing them if you decide to use rocket bombs to wipe out enemies. The eighth mission, the mission that involves you fighting terrorists on a plane,  proves to be difficult because a woman in a blue dress stands up and gets in the line of fire, and you have to very careful when you're going to use rocket bombs.

There are two endings to this game, and which ending you can watch will depend on the number of hostages you've saved, and whether or not you shot the pilot instead of the mission eight boss.

Although you're racing against the other cars, you must make each checkpoint in the required amount of time in order to complete the game. The lap is split into three sections, so the fourth section is identical to the first, the fifth to the second, and so on. 

As the game goes on, the bonus time offered for each section drops, so you have to drive better as the game goes on to stay in. Night is represented as well, with everything darkened and the need for headlights. The circuit features barriers and trackside trees, so avoid contact with these, and try not to stray onto the grass as this slows you down.

Your vehicle is equipped with a machine gun to help you out, and occasionally a weapons plane will fly in and drop additional power ups that can be collected. Some of these are the U.Z. canon, cruise missiles, and speed boost. Your car has a very limited amount of fuel, however more can be picked up along the way by crossing the halfway point of a level, or by collecting the red and green fuel spheres that appear in the road or after destroying certain enemies.  On many levels collecting fuel is critical otherwise you won't be able to reach the finish line.

		<name>Max Headroom</name>
		<desc>This game is based on a 1984 British television movie which led to a 14-episode television series that ran in 1987 in the U.S.  It's an early cyberpunk vision set "twenty minutes in the future" where powerful corporations rule and compete for television ratings and consumer dollars.  Edison Carter is an investigative reporter for Network 23 seeking to free his alter ego Max Headroom, a cybernetic construct of his mind that was stored after Edison was involved in a motorcycle accident and the last thing he saw before losing consciousness was a "Max Headroom" sign going into a tunnel.  Max lives in computers and can appear on any screen, television or any electronic device.  The character is actually Matt Frewer in a latex mask, edited so as to appear jittery and stuttering like an early computer model.  

In the game, Max has been abducted by Network 23 and you must retrieve him from somewhere in the 11 top floors of their high-rise building starting at the 200th floor.  Security systems protect each floor and you have to find and enter the correct codes to gain access from the elevators.  Each floor seen in isometric view, has lines representing walls of various rooms with doors and office furniture.  Robots will chase and fire at you and decrease your health level as shown on the biomonitor at bottom of screen.  Also indicated are the floor number and time left.  On the right side of screen are 4 icons for Reporter E. Carter which open a door, call elevator, view through camera, or allow movement to run around the floor.  On the left side are icons for Controller T. Jones (Theora helps you hack into systems) to show you the floor and computer circuits.  

When entering a security code, it takes the form of an LED digit over which you must move a pointer over a row of circuit lines in order to activate various segments to form a desired digit.  Each segment will remain lit only temporarily so when time runs out you must ensure that the letter is fully lit or your code will fail.  In that event, you must make your way across the floor to the second elevator and try again.

		<desc>The castle comprises of single-screen rooms, each with multiple exits which begin sealed, and are also sealed when used (so as to prevent backtracking). Your gun's missiles are only effective in destroying these walls whilst charged with theta radiation. Thus, you will have to shoot Urks (8 for a full recharge) along the way to keep it active. 

Each room is followed by a passage, which has time-locked doors and thus involves surviving against further tough enemies - Neucleods breed rapidly to create large bolts of energy, while Orphacs bounce off walls to provide primitive security. You have 1000 points of energy, which are lost with contact with these oaming creatures.

		<desc>Zeppelin's second game licensed from the successful darts player has a much wider scope than the previous Jocky Wilson's Darts Challenge. The control system involves directing a hand which guides the dart, but this is constantly moving in a random arc, reflecting realistic jitters but making accurate aiming difficult at first. The standard 501 darts rules are among the six games included.

The other games include variants loosely based on football (hit the bulls-eye to start scoring, then a double adds one goal to your score) and bowls (in which a 'jack' dart is thrown by one player, and the aim is to get your darts as close to it as possible). There are also Ten-Dart century (score exactly 100 with 10 darts), Shanghai (where only darts thrown at a particular area can score) and Scram (where one player shoots to successively knock sectors out of play, and the opponent must score as much as possible from the others).

Indy is armed with his trusty whip to fight off foes, but can also get involved in hand-to-hand combat.

In order to do this, Quaid must go through level after level of beating up bad guys that get in his way.

Some of the levels differ in gameplay, and range between action and driving scenes. The action scenes mainly require you to collect some items before leaving the level. You have only one chance to complete the current level, which means that if your energy is lost, the game ends. Energy is lost if you are attacked by an obstacle, or if you are shot at by an enemy. You can gain more energy by either collecting some pills or a heart, depending on the platform.

		<name>Moonwalker</name>
		<desc>Moonwalker is broken up into 4 levels. 
The first level has you walking around avoiding fans trying to find parts of a rabbit costume needed to disguise yourself from your fans. You then need to find the waiting motorbike to escape to level 2 - Michaelsville.
Here you need to find orbs which transform your bike into the glittering Stratus car able to leap barriers. If you get far enough you escape via a jetski.
Level 3 has you defending yourself in Club 30 against Mr Big's task force.
And the final level has you in an arena fighting Mr Big's Storm Troopers and plasma cannon as Moonwalker himself - survive and save the children.

Sending down armies of androids from his space ship, he enslaved the planet Zyron and forced its inhabitants to work in mines and gather Chromazin, a rare mineral, for him. You are a Zyronean who has made a plan to free the planet from Kayleth' reign. However, as the game begins, you find yourself trapped in an unknown place with no memory of the events that led you to this situation. In order to find out where you are, what happened to you and ultimately save your home planet, you will have to interact with several (android) characters, solve various puzzles and survive encounters with ferocious creatures.

		<desc>You find yourself in a world where the air has become unbreathable and Sun's light barely reaches planet Earth. With your planet almost desertic, many cities began to be built in other planets of the solar system. But... in Oberon, the fourth satellite, there appeared an strange life form, which did just awake from its lethargy. The worst of all is that these new creatures have started attacking the human populations, even if they are babies!

Without wasting any more second, you decide to go to Oberon to save the few babies still alive, before they are eaten by these monsters. Once there, your mission would be to find the babies and send them to planet Earth in a safe way. For this, you will have to buy a cryogenic valve for each one of them in the ATMs of the Company, in order to provide them more safe travel. When you finish the mission, you will have to buy a ticket back to Earth.

Oberon 69 is an arcade platformer where you will have to use your pistol to kill larvae, tentacles, robots, alien queens and her eggs, with the advantage that you can make frontal or vertical shots.

Yogi must travel across Yellowstone Park to rescue his friend Boo-Boo, who has been kidnapped. Travel through 198 screens to reach him, collecting six toffee apples en route - these are converted into a code which allows Boo-Boo to be rescued without his kidnapper raising a fuss.

The park scrolls sideways, with Yogi moving into and out of the layered screens. It contains animals who can harm you on contact, as well as black holes and water hazards. Contact with the park ranger or tourists is also forbidden. Yogi must watch his energy level, which is kept up by swiping fish and pick-a-nick baskets. Boo-Boo must be rescued before he and Yogi have to hibernate for the winter.

Hazards include crocodiles, stray logs and branches, and fishermen - you are armed with a limited supply of tin cans to take care of these. There are gates to slide through on the way down - these give you a points bonus. Each level has a strict time limit to adhere to, although there's a kickin' party at the end if you succeed.

		<name>3D Space Wars</name>
		<desc>The first game to star the evil Seiddab, 3D Space Wars gives exactly what the title promises. As soon as you warp into outer space, your cockpit screen is filled with alien spaceships which must be shot down, for you are mankind's last hope, armed with the Earth's only remaining battle spaceship.

Gameplay is arcade-oriented, with few cockpit gauges and displays to keep in mind. The three cockpit instruments are your radar, speed readout and fuel meter. You run out of fuel when you fire your phasors and when you are hit by enemy fire. You can replenish your fuel by docking with the fuel station which comes into view from time to time. Once all Seiddab spacecraft in the area are destroyed, you warp into the next zone.

This was the first commercial game by Steve Turner (Spectrum) and Andrew Braybrook (Dragon).

		<desc>In principle, this is yet another (technically very impressive) horizontally scrolling shoot-'em-up. The interesting twist about the scenario is that it doesn't play in space like the similar game R-Type and most of its clones - instead, the fight between good and evil is underwater.

Through five levels, you have to shoot countless enemies, complete with the obligatory mid-level and end-level bosses. The most innovative part of this game comes after a level when you get to purchase new weapons - instead of simply buying upgrades, you can customize your ship by placing your new weapons anywhere on it.

		<desc>He raised from the Hell and sighed. On his face the wrath of a demon and the ambition of thousand devils. He sprouted like a bad seed in the temple of Shaolin, whose walls lodged the best fighters of all times. The destiny has decided that the last hour for the good has arrived, because the yellow devil seized the original manuscript where Cheng Heung wrote the art of the Choy Lee Fut.

Supported on the force of the five magical animals, the speed and the technique of a good apprentice, we will cross the temple of Shaolin until finding the monster and recovering the scroll. We are expert in punches, we handle the sabre with ferocity and make the flexible lance more penetrating and versatile. And all thanks to the Chi. As first action, we will have the possibility of training with the Dummies (the wood men), where we will practice the distance, the speed and the use of complementary techniques. From which we will get up ourselves into the dynamics of the fight and the confrontations hand-to-hand with the partisans of the evildoer.

The movements are varied, all of them based on the Fung-Fu techniques. With different arms we will be able to execute different movements using the same keys. Everything depends on the animal that our personage will adopt. The graphical theme also changes according to the fight scenes, including the face of the old man that observes us.

As with so many Dinamic games, the two parts are loaded separately, but the second can't be accessed until a password (provided at the end of part one) is input.

Contact with the enemies en route (which are mostly mutant demons) drains your limited energy, and you are also working against a time limit on each section. As well as your magical powers (which are stronger in part two), you can collect swords to attack, as well as lightning bolts which can be collected to destroy all enemies on screen. In part two vanquished foes release coins, which can be spent at shop sections on rechargers, shields and teleporters amongst other things.

		<desc>Monty Mole has been living in luxury since his previous adventures, but he has now been beamed up by an alien race who want him to do a job for them. Monty must trek through five worlds to retrieve the sacred scrolls of the race's Guardians. 

As with Core's previous hit Rick Dangerous 2 there is versatility in the exact structure of the game. The first four consist of the Orient, a Klondike mine, an Ice world and an Amazon forest - once these are completed the final world is open to you.

The platform-based gameplay is similar to Monty's earlier games, with primarily horizontal progresses as well as ropes and ladders to navigate. Monty has developed a useful flying kick, and has been given a smart bomb, with the potential to collect extra bombs and guns. Hazards, enemies and level designs are themed around each level, and range from cable cars and falling snowballs to Ninjas and Monkeys.

		<desc>Finding the mysterious Elephant's Graveyard in Africa was your Father's lifelong quest. When he disappears you are determined to find out what might have happened to him, and what secrets may lie within.

This side scrolling arcade adventure is split into three stages, taking in the harsh and barren desert, an underground network of caves, and a tough tribal jungle. The natives are hostile to your presence, and weaponry must be found to fend them off, although its use does little to put the natives at ease initially. The machete to cut through the jungle is equally important. At many other points you will need to use objects you have found along the way. The backgrounds are in full 3D and can serve to obscure the character when he is behind trees or rocks.

		<desc>A sequel to the previous Grand Prix Simulator, a popular Super Sprint style racing game.

As before, the action is viewed from overhead across a succession of tracks featuring hairpins, oil slicks and similar hazards. You must complete each race within the time limit; and time left after one race is added to your allowance on the next one. After the race you can view a replay.

The two main new features are a 3-player mode (there are always 3 cars present in total) and a damage meter which mean that repeat contract with barriers or other cars hampers your performance.

		<desc>An arcade adventure, the action in Realm Of The Undead takes place over three stages.

In the first stage, the player finds himself in the gardens of the Dark Lord's (Dracula's) domain, carrying three cloves of garlic. The player is advised to explore to collect more garlic, whilst avoiding the tarantulas that roam through the garden. Finding the secret exit will progress the player to the next stage.

In the second stage, the player explores the castle dungeons, avoiding vampire bats and more tarantulas, freeing trapped villagers whilst looking for the mystical entrance that will transport the player to the third and final stage of the game.

In the last stage, the player must explore the zombie-infested area around Dracula's own coffin to find the hammer and stake necessary to rid the land of the Dark Lord's menace. Moving into various areas will awaken Dracula to your presence, however, and send him in search of your blood. Three bites from the Dark Lord and you're sent back to stage one to start over again.

		<name>Xenon</name>
		<desc>Xenon is the obscure and mysterious predecessor to the much better known Xenon 2: Megablast. The game is actually nothing like its sequel, with completely different control scheme and gameplay. The plot overlaps however, with the Xenites making their first attempt to control the galaxy.

Xenon is essentially an overhead shooter, where the player controls the ship and moves around the screen. However, the difference between Xenon and its sequel is that here the player actually controls the movement of the playfield (up or down) by simply moving the ship in the direction of choice. To do this in the sequel, players need to slam your ship against the bottom of the screen and pull back on the stick in order to reverse-scroll the playfield.

It also features a 3D playfield (some enemies, for example, will be mounted on hills of sort, where players can't shoot them). To combat these the player can transform its tank into a plane. The game then switches to the more familiar gameplay style as seen in other vertically scrolling shooters. The plane has to transform back into a tank again to combat most ground units.

In Xenon, upgrades are taken from destroyed enemies.

Thus begins a thirteen level game of ladders and platforms through which you must dig holes for the KENS to fall through, luring them into the traps if you must.

The aliens start off green. Once they fall though the first hole they become red. Get them to fall through a second hole and they become white. Get them to fall through a third and that finishes them off.
There are controls for left / right / up / down / dig / fill and pause,

The aim is to escape the confines of the Keep by talking to other characters and collecting and swapping objects.

Interaction is achieved by pressing fire and selecting options from a pop-up menu. Many of the other characters have mini-quests that will ultimately allow you to leave the keep via the drawbridge.

You control a bat, which must 'serve' the ball into play, and then follow it through the level, deflecting it before it falls behind you, as this costs you one of your 4 lives. Initially the obstacles are all static, but moving barriers add timing, reactions and luck to proceedings.

There are also several bonus objects, which are collected by passing through them. These include an L for an extra ball and dual rectangles to give you a second bat which moves around at random.

The game also comes with a full level editor, allowing you to design new levels and save them to tape or disk.

		<name>Butcher Hill</name>
		<desc>Intelligence reports suggest that POWs have been captured and are being held hostage at the guerilla outpost on Butcher Hill. The game is divided into three sections. 

In the first section, players steer their dinghy along a river while avoiding mines and other obstacles. If the dinghy comes into contact with any mine, it explodes. However, when the player has collected ammo, the mines can be destroyed. Coming into contact with rocks causes the dinghy to bounce out of the water for a short distance. When a jetty appears, pressing the fire button allows the player to land and start the next section.

The second section has the player finding their way through dense jungle whose path lead to the enemy camp at the base of Butcher Hill. Stopping you from proceeding are soldiers that have orders to shoot you on sight. Mines are also scattered around the jungle floor and must be avoided. If players were able to obtain a compass in the first section, their current direction will be displayed at the right of the control panel. Shooting all the soldiers in the jungle gives the player extra ammunition and stamina.  

In the final section, players need to destroy the enemy camp by blowing up huts with bullets or grenades. While they are doing that, they must also be on the lookout for any soldiers that tries to leave the camp to bring back more soldiers.

A course editor is provided.  The courses provided include real courses like St. Andrews, a fictional designs such as The Gauntlet, which as the name suggests is designed to push your skills to the maximum.

The PC version revolutionized the use of the PC speaker to reproduce voice samples via their patented "RealSound" process. Quips like "No doubt about it, he's deep in the sandtrap", "Straight onto the fairway", and "Looks like he hit the tree, Jim." are used to provide running commentary on the gameplay.

There are barriers along the way to avoid, often set in quick succession, and lots of bad guys to shoot at or avoid - their shots must be avoided too. Some parts of the track are blocked unless you can shoot through obstacles before reaching them, or hit a jump pad. At some points you can change to travelling along the ceiling as well. Tokens can be collected en route, and used to obtain better weapons, but losing a life costs you the best one you’ve currently got.

Jump through the 8 screens, collecting all the crosses before going through the exit, and avoiding snakes and other hazards. Watch out for booby traps, and make sure not to touch the crosses when they have become burning effigies - either of these indiscretions costs one of your nine lives.

You play the Road Runner. You must run along the road, avoiding trucks, landmines, falling rocks, etc. and also not get caught by Wile E. Coyote. You must also eat birdseed along the way or you will become faint and Wile E. will catch you.

You can get points for eating birdseed and making Wile E. get hit by trucks, falling rocks, etc.

The Amstrad CPC, Commodore 64 and ZX Spectrum versions are one player only. The Atari 2600 version is one or two player, alternating. The Atari 2600 version also has another difference in that you don't HAVE to eat the birdseed but you can for the points. This may have been due to programming constraints on the Atari 2600.

Your mission is to storm the island and recapture it. This takes place over the course of 6 different sequences. The first sequence is Aerial Reconnissance where the fleet must be moved directly past the enemy or into a hidden passage. Optional is this Hidden Passage sequence, where the player will have to manuever around mines and torpedos. Once encountering the enemy, the General Quaters sequence starts, where the player controls anti-aircraft guns shooting down enemy aircraft. The next sequence is named Battle Stations and the player must aim and fire heavy guns to aim at the enemy ships before they get too close. Following this fleet battle, the player's fleet must be manuvered to the beach. Upon reaching the Beach-head, tanks roll out and the player must keep these safe from enemy fire. In the Final Battle sequence, the Dictator is holed up in the fortress of Kuhn-Lin and 10 different targets on the fortress must be fired upon to destroy it.

As Resistance member Pierre LeFeu, helped by wounded former engineer Le Duc, must prevent this happening, but taking the paintings by train to Normandy and Allied control.

Once in control of the train, you must set the throttle level, ensure that there is enough coal in the furnace, control the speed, and ensure that steam is released when necessary. Use the provided map, and the communications network once released, to plan the strategic side of your mission. Each station has coal and water supplies which may be needed to keep the train running.

You must raid railway stations in order to get track switches into the right position. Both this and the initial capture of the train involve aiming at the enemy, current indicated point, and ducking before their bullets can hit you. Taking control of bridges is similar - you control a cannon and must take aim.

First of all, you must safely land your ship on the landing strip, by paying attention to the angle the craft descends at, and keeping it in line with the smooth terrain.

Once this has been accomplished, you must walk around the planet searching for their life pod, and take it back to the ship. This must be done within a time limit, as the pod's life support system is failing. In both these sections you will score more points if your direction is correct (with 8 points the requirement for a clean landing in section one) - this acts as both a reward and a guide.

		<name>Phantis</name>
		<desc>The Serena Commander have the mission to rescue his companion of expedition captured in Moon 4 of System Sotpok, better known like the world Phantis, an unusual place inhabited by a hostile fauna and exuberant flora.

Phantis is an horizontal shooter (R-Type like), combined with platform arcade levels (Turrican like). You have 24 different enemies to beat throughout 4 phases and 6 levels.

This program has two parts, recorded individually on cassette versions. In order to play the second, it's necessary to discover the access code, which is granted when finishing the first.That procedure was called FX Doble Carga (FX Double Charge), and designed to give more hours of addictive playing.

		<name>Mysterious Adventure #08 - The Wizard of Akyrz</name>
		<desc>The Wizard of Akyrz is the eighth game in the in the Mysterious Adventures series. The player begins in the royal palace, where the king asks him to save his daughter from an evil wizard. If the player should succeed, his reward will be priceless.

Most instructions are either 90-degree compass moves, or VERB NOUN commands such as GET PAINTING, FIT CHAIN and CLIMB TREE. On the player's journey he will discover treasures, which must be stored in a special room, reached via a spell. 

Around this time, the Mysterious Adventures game engine was redone to allow complete sentences, instead of the 2-word Scott Adams parser that had been used previously.

Ele não consegue pular, mas as fases contêm raios vermelhos que permitem ao jogador se movimentar para cima e para baixo. Os inimigos se movem em um padrão pseudo aleatório que deve ser evitado. Além disso, deve-se também evitar contato com as caveiras, já que elas lhe custam uma vida - assim como ficar muito tempo sem comer um cogumelo. Passwords permitem ao jogador retornar a fases avançadas.</desc>

		<name>Zorro</name>
		<desc>All the ingredients from the Zorro story feature in this action game - a kidnapped senorita, an evil enemy leader (Colonel Garcia) and his henchmen and of course the obligatory swordfight!

This computer version of Zorro is a strange beast, he can leap across buildings, fall 50 feet and land like a feather, with neither a scratch to his head or a crease in his cape. He can also perform masterful tricks, such as balancing a large plant pot on his head, while simultaneously climbing up a ladder.

Zorro has similar platform gameplay to the same company's Bruce Lee game, but with a slower pace and more puzzle elements. There are 20 different screens in the game, with The Ole Hotel screen being used continually throughout the game. The player must overcome various puzzles, including the branding of a bull and catapulting into the air via a conveniently left spring board and a dazed Garcia guard!

One of the A.R.C.'s crew got high on drugs and not only did they sabotage the ship they released a number of deadly creatures. The crew are probably all dead but the ship is still intact and worth a lot of money. Your job is to board her, repair her, reach the bridge and activate the E.H.D. (Emergency Homing Device)


Armed only with a decimator cannon, and anything else they come across, the player must explore the ship, repair it, and return to Earth to collect their bonus.

This game supports the standard commands such as GET and DROP together with shortcuts such as N/S/E/W for North/South/East/West. Other commands such as SHOOT, KILL, STAB, KICK are also needed</desc>

		<desc>When Rogorf, leader of the Phibiatrons, needs more iron ore, he sets out to capture the human colony Cerius and enslave its people. Armed with an Avenger IV tank (complete with blasters, smart bombs and a limited shield), your mission is to infiltrate his well-guarded lair. 

Cerius is a flick-screen shoot ‘em up, characterised by your Avenger unit being unable to jump, needing instead to rely on the arrangement of teleporters in order to navigate Rogorf’s base. Push up to enter these; the same applies for the improved weapons, ammo dumps and energy boosts. Completing the levels requires considerable back-tracking, a fact made more awkward for the player by the fact that the screens reset when you leave them.

Each of the three levels contains four Guardian enemies, all of which must be destroyed. This is because they each release a letter, which must be rearranged to form the correct four-letter password for the final door.

		<desc>This game is a simulator based on a minority sport: the free climbing. It's a climbing discipline in which you must use the hands (obviously) and special boots as ascend elements. For, and this is the key of "Free Climbing", it's necessary that the wall to climb is furrowed by cracks and spurs which the climber can use as strong-point. 

This game also includes 14 different walls that we must try to climb by means of this system, but considering that we have a time limit to culminate each ascend. Our climber can independently move each one of his arms and legs, and our mission consists in finding out which of his extremities we must move to obtain a good power and strong-point to thus continue our climb.

		<desc>Sury Ani 7 has been a source of mined resources for many a year, but now that it is contaminated, the only way to harvest its bounty is to do so remotely. Worse still, the security system of defence droids is active, and primed to damage anything which attempts to penetrate the surface. 

As such, you are in control of a Dedicated Disposal Droid in, which must eventually shut down the security system and clear the area of radioactive material. This is done by throwing it down the disposal chute on each of the 8 levels, but you only have limited time before they explode. Fuel is limited and must be found within the complex, with the retro-thrust move using it up particularly quickly. To reach the next level you must find the appropriate pass.

		<name>The Trap Door</name>
		<desc>Berk is trying to obtain a chest of treasure from within a castle inhabited by the Bad Tempered Thing. This involves completing five tasks, although a learner mode in which only 4 are required is also provided. The first task is to provide a can of worms, whilst crushed eyeballs must be provided for task two. You then need to boil Slimies, fry eggs (getting them is a dilemma in itself), and then force everything back into the trapdoor. These tasks must be completed before Thing’s Angry Meter reaches its limit.

As fans of the TV show will recall, the Trap Door of the title seals in numerous strange monsters, and in the game some are harmful and some are a hindrance, depending on the task at hand, so be careful which ones are released. Remember to close it, as spooks will be released if you do not – these require food to be pacified. Boni and Drutt appear regularly – the former giving cryptic morsels of advice, and the latter eating spiders and getting in the way. You can prepare for one task while completing another, so pay attention to items which may be useful, and think about what they are likely to be used in conjunction with.

		<desc>This game aims to recreate five-a-side football as accurately as possible, from a side-on forced perspective. The main tournament involves 8 international teams, with 2 skill levels and variable match lengths.

Five a side football differs from the full game in many ways. The teams consist of 4 outfield players and a goalkeeper – the outfield players can’t encroach into the goal area (which is a semi-circle rather than a rectangle). The arena is walled, making judging ricochets important, and the ball can’t be hit above head height.

Every month, one of those groups makes a request. You can accept it (which might involve quite a bit of money) or deny it, making groups either happy or not.

As the old saying goes.. it's impossible to make everybody happy. So sooner or later, you'll be facing a revolution or assassination attempt. Did you purchase that helicopter or are you going to face the music?

The gameplay is platform and ladders based, set both inside and outside. The layout of the territories becomes visible as you progress, and they can contain bonus weapons and secret rooms. Unlike the sequel you start without weaponry, and this is gained directly, rather than you collecting coins and trading them at shop sections. Holding down fire progressively builds up your fighting power.

		<desc>Ad Astra was an early into-the-screen 3D space shoot 'em up. Your craft is viewed in front of you, with the first task being to dart in between the planets which hurtle towards you. Once this is passed, the serious business of shooting down the enemy craft begins. These shoot at you from a distance, and your angle of attack varies depending on the angle at which you are flying into the screen, in a sort of trick-3D. 

Landmines (shoot these before they disintegrate towards you) and flying saucers (which don't shoot at you, but must be shot several times), before the task of noting down a code to enable you to progress to the next moon, from which the whole task begins again with increased difficulty. The game keeps track of how long you have been playing each game, as well as a high score.

		<desc>Run Baby Run is unusual among games of this vintage in that it sets you as the 'bad' guy - in this case a getaway driver attempting to flee the scene of a robbery. Six police cars will immediately give chase, and your task is to block them off so as to cause them to collide with each other. 

A seventh car is on guard at the entrance (the bottom left of the screen) and this will chase you, armed with a rocket launcher, once all 6 other cars have crashed. You must reach the southern wall without being hit to complete the level. 

There are five of these, with the cars becoming faster as you progress. 8 speed levels are available, with more points available on the faster ones.

But when the government of Hydra has asked for your help in defeating Hydra's enemies by couriering parts to a secret weapon, and those enemies know you're coming... well then, life gets interesting.

Race down narrow swamp lanes to deliver parts of a secret weapon to bases at the finish of each section.  Enemies will be shooting at you, but you can shoot back with Uzi Cannons and Nukes.  Collect crystals along the way to boost your speed or shields.

		<name>Rambo III</name>
		<desc>Rambo's mission is set deep in Afghanistan, in the days when the Soviets occupied it, and America was putting this right (we won't mention who they enlisted to do so). Colonel Trautman has been kidnapped by the Soviets, and you've gone in there to rescuing him. Doing so is a three-part operation approximately following the plot of the film.

In the first part, you explore the building Trautman could be in, through a top-down view of the building. It is heavily protected by infra-red security beams, which when activated unleadsh the enemies. The locations of the beams are only apparent if you collect the special goggles. Other hazards include mines, trapdoors and booby-trapped doors, but there are enhanced weapons to collect.

Section two is identical to the first, except that it is located outside, the enemy are onto you from the start, and there are no traps. The final section changes to an Operation Wolf-style shoot 'em up, with a horde of tanks, foot soldiers and helicopters to face. Your gun can jam, which adds to the challenge of finally getting out alive.

As such, you will have to help the racket (in this case, a nut), to impulse the ball in order to break as much bricks as possible, although there would be others that will be indestructible by your hit. To make your work more complex, there will be some flying enemies that will modify the trajectory of your ball and in the worst of the cases even shot at you, thus reducing your energy bar. In order to avoid being defeated by these creatures, you have one laser which just one projectile that recharges itself occasionally, so you will have to use it wisely too.

Billy and Jimmy Lee are returning from martial arts training when their paths cross a fortune teller. She tells them of a great evil in Egypt, their strongest adversary yet, and how the Rosetta Stones can aid them.

This game features weapon shops where Billy and Jimmy can buy power-ups, tricks, energy and extra lives to aid them in their quest.

Power-ups make Billy and Jimmy twice their size, increasing their damage done and range of attack.

The character graphics have changed, moving away from cartoon style graphics to more realistic looking characters.</desc>

		<desc>As BLOB, the Bio-Logically Operated Being, you are sent into an unstable planet and charged with the task of preventing it from exploding. This involves collecting various items (the exact combination is different every time you load the game) and taking them to the planet's core.

The game is an arcade adventure viewed from the side, with 512 screens arranged in a 16x32 pattern. A teleport system exists, so once you find the codes you can get quick access to different parts of the game.

The creatures to avoid are intelligent, getting tougher to predict as you get closer to the centre, but you are armed with a gun and can also try to avoid them. BLOB has a set of platforms which can be used to allow limited vertical movement, but these disappear after a few seconds each use.

You will of course meet many more fighters throughout the level, and pick up improved weapons as the game goes on (neither of which fit with the film, or real-life logic, but make for Generic Ocean Film License #718). The gameplay is primarily side-scrolling, but the levels are taller than the screen.

You control Maroc's astral projection which can cast spells to achieve various parts of the quest, the objective is to advance in sixteen ranks by exploring the world and collecting spells and ultimately destroy the Lord of Chaos.

Maroc starts outside a castle where a spell descends upon him and projects his astral projection inside it. The projection can only act or move through the use of spells.The two basic spells are movement and servant spells. The move spell allows the projection to move around and the servant spell summons a spirit that can move about and collect objects or other spells for Maroc. Only up to four objects can be carried around at a time and there are around 220 locations on eight levels. Enemies will attack the projection and drain it's energy which can be replenished with a spell, if depleted the projection is destroyed and the game reverts to Maroc outside the castle, ready for another go.</desc>

		<desc>Pool is a fairly simple game using cue-ball physics and concepts, played on a standard 6 pocket table. As well as the cue ball there are 3 red and 3 blue balls.With each shot you are aiming to pot one of these - the score being either 10 (red) or 20 (blue) multiplied by the level of the game, and by how many shots it took you to pot one. If you go through 3 shots without potting anything, or commit a foul stroke, a life is lost - you start with 4. Once you've cleared the table, you move onto the next level, where scores are multiplied. 2 human players can play alternately, with each one aiming to outscore the other.

		<desc>Mankind has established a distant colony, but the area is infested with ants, ladybirds and other parasites, all ready to cut through the perimeter fencing and eat your people's food. As a service droid it is your job to prevent this, and maximise the output.

Achieving this involves a lot of planning and resource management. There are several buildings at your disposal, containing seeds, solar panels, weaponry, fencing and traps. You must plant the seeds, use the solar panels to maximise their growth, and then harvest the finished product so as to trade it. You can carry a gun to take care of the bugs, but this needs recharging frequently, and the location of the munitions store must be determined.

When the bugs break part of the fence, you need to replace it to stop lots more coming through. This can be done more quickly by reducing the compound size, which causes the trade-off loss of growing room.

The Lilli-Punies have kidnapped them, and will only let them free if they can rescue their missing compatriots.

The search starts on the surface of the planet, but also takes Ruff underground into the cavernous regions the Lilli-Punies live in. These have lots of water, which Ruff must avoid. Plenty of extra lives can be collected along the way, with solving puzzles as important as good reactions and dexterity.

		<desc>This single-screen top-down action puzzler stars Pippo, a cute creature who must change the colour of each square on a screen. There are 32 levels – the concept is that the number of times a square must be stepped on to change it to the right colour starts at one and increases every four levels, but there’s a bug in the game meaning that odd-numbered levels always need one change, and even-numbered levels always need two. The levels are on 6x4 grids, although these include lots of holes, which Pippo must avoid. 

There are also many nasties patrolling the area – some kill him, while others reset any previous colour changes but can be killed on contact (The Bobby Yazz Show has a similar design on this element). Pacman-style power pills temporarily change enemies into harmless springs. The game features a lot of technical effects and hardware tricks, including full-screen numbers using the normally-blank border.

The journey takes in Hyde Park, Ice Caverns, Forest and Atomic Mines. He must solve positional puzzles and memorise the locations of laser bolts and booby traps, as well as avoiding enemies including robots, penguins and nomads. As in the first game, a fifth level is unlocked after you complete the four standard levels.

Rick can climb ladders and crawl through tight spaces. He is equipped with a laser gun and six little bombs, but can also punch with some effect. The controls are very easy to understand: pressing fire+up shoots the gun, pressing fire+down places a bomb, pressing fire+bottom-left/bottom-right makes Rick slide a bomb along the floor in the specified direction.

Moving onto a screen at a time you must shoot out anything and everything in your path, including lots of regenerating static targets. Realistic gravity takes effect, so you can't simply hover in a set position.

		<name>Snookered</name>
		<desc>Trivial Snooker on your computer. Snookered is a quiz game with a snooker backdrop. You start off attempting to pot a red ball, the computer will ask you a red ball question, which are general knowledge, not too difficult and worth - like the red ball in snooker - ONE point. The computer will show four answers (A, B, C or D) and you must choose the correct one. If you do then the red ball will be potted and you will move onto a colour of your choice (Yellow, Blue or Black); these questions are worth the amount corresponding to the snooker ball of that colour - 2, 5 or 7 and are in an ascending order of difficulty and a lower time limit.
Once you have answered a colour ball question it's back onto a red ball, then a colour and so on. The game ends when you have potted 16 red snooker balls or when you have answered two questions incorrectly.

With a full 3D view, you must first take them on in the cities, shooting 10 down to face the leading man. A scanner is provided to give you a view of which streets the Seiddab lurk on, allowing you to steer left and right to reach them, as well as adjusting your sights to take them down.

Once cleared, you move onto an open-plan countryside area, with more units coming towards you, and they now drop bombs towards you, putting your 3 lives at a greater premium.

		<path>./Flintstones, The (Europe).tzx</path>
		<name>The Flintstones</name>
		<desc>The Flintstones is a game based on the popular cartoon series The Flintstones by Hanna-Barbera Productions Inc.

It's weekend! Fred Flintstone thinks of only one thing: bowling  
with his friend and neighbor Barney.
Unfortunately, his wife Wilma got other plans for him. Fred has to paint the living room and Wilma is not going to help him with it. No, she goes shopping.
And if that's not enough, Wilma also tells Fred that his mother-in-law is coming over.

The Flintstones game is divided in four parts.

Part 1: Painting the walls of your living room.
To go to the bowling alley before it is closed Fred has to paint  the walls as quickly as possible. To paint the walls Fred uses the tail of a living squirrel. 
Pebbles tries to leap out her playpen and starts crawling around and starts scribbling on the walls. If Fred wants to put Pebbles back in the playpen then he has to drop the squirrel, that immediately starts wandering off. When Pebbles is back in the playpen Fred has to chase the squirrel and dip its tail in the paint again.

Part 2: Driving your car on the way to the bowling center.
Finally, when all walls are painted Fred can go to the bowling  
alley!
Fred has to drive to the bowling alley but unfortunately the roads are in a very bad condition. The road surface is dire and covered with rocks!
And if one of the wheels hit a bump it will break off the car and disappear into the distance.

Part 3: A bowling competition between Fred and Barney.
At the bowling alley the following bowling parameters can be set: the spin and speed of the ball and the starting position of the player.
Each turn gives two throws (except he gets a strike). A game  
takes ten turns. while a match takes three games.

Part 4: Saving Pebbles at a construction site.
On his way home Fred discovers that Pebbles has disappeared!  Don't let Wilma find that out!
Fred finds Pebbles at a construction site on top of some  
scaffolding. He has to climb the scaffolding to rescue her.
If Fred fails to rescue his daughter then Barney rescues her and Fred will be branded as a failure!

		<desc>Published by ACE Software and developed by Cybadyne, who are also responsible for a very similar game named Master Blaster, this shoot-em-up embarks you and possibly a friend in multiplayer on a quest to defeat the Zedar. 
The concept of the gameplay is simple, but the game is hard to master or even complete, necessitating a memorization of the patterns in which the enemies or end-level bosses attack. 
It can be controlled with either the keyboard, a joystick or any combination between the two.
The game was advertised as the "first coin-op style game for the Spectrum to feature options for 1 player or 2 players (on screen as the same time!)"

Gameplay is viewed form just above and behind the car, so you can see it. The roads are full of sharp bends and hazards, contact with which can cause the car to roll and lose you time. On each section of track there is a fork in the road, allowing you to choose which direction you go in. You have to complete 5 track sections in total, out of the 15 in the game.

		<desc>Captain Planet was an amalgam of youths from around the world, and aimed to rid the world of global warming and climate change. His three foes in this game are Sly Sludge (who is trying to turn earth into a perma-sunny holiday resort, by using excess CFCs to destroy the ozone layer), Looten Plunder (who has kidnapped dolphins for experimentation) and Doctor Blight (who is destroying the rainforests).

Controlling Captain Planet himself, you start off by flying into the screen, collecting time bonus and avoiding hitting stars. Once you've hit one, the main shoot 'em up body of the game starts. The Captain runs and flies, while firing a fusion of fire, water and air. He must stop those enemies of mankind by destroying their rockets, barrels of poison and their minions. Each level ends by facing them as bosses.

		<name>Xeno</name>
		<desc>Xeno is a future sport resembling Air Hockey. Each of the two players (the second being either human or computer controlled) controls a ground skimmer, which is aiming to hit a puck so as to knock it into their opponent's goal. This is done in a turn-based manner, in which each player controls a movement line which sets up their intended move before it is enacted. 

The arena is surrounded by walls, so rebounds (of both the puck and the skimmers) have to be factored into your shot selection. You are not required to hit the puck with a shot, so some shots can be defensive-minded. You can toggle between 1 and 9 seconds for the shot time, and between 1 and 9 minutes for the length of each of the four quarters.

		<name>Carrier Command</name>
		<desc>Carrier Command was one of the first real-time strategy games.

You control an advanced cybernetic aircraft carrier complete with fighters, amphibious assault vehicles, laser defenses and a fleet of decoy drones.  Your mission is to build a series of resource, factory, and defensive bases spanning an island chain.  The only problem?  At the other end of the chain is an even more advanced carrier under control of a terrorist organization with the same mission.

As you move around the islands you must decide what facilities to build and where they will best support your advance.  Resource islands provide materials that factory islands can use to build weapons and vehicles to replace your combat losses but both will be quickly overrun if the enemy attacks them while you are not present.  You also have to ensure that your stockpiles of equipment are stored safely until you can find time to launch a resupply drone to bring them to your carrier.

From your carrier, you can take first person control of your attack aircraft and amphibious tanks and use them to assault enemy islands or even the enemy carrier itself if you're lucky enough to find it.  The weapon payloads on your vehicles are completely configurable based on your needs.  An island invasion may require launching a virus bomb that will take over the enemy command systems or just blasting the base with a wire guided surface to surface missile.

Ultimately, you have to find and destroy the enemy carrier but, doing so will require a solid supply infrastructure and a strategy for depriving your opponent of his.

Brian must wander through 100 locations looking for the Crown Jewels and sit on the throne. Objects are scattered throughout each location, and Brian needs to figure out their purpose. Monsters – such as ducks, Daleks, Mad Scotsmen, and Turkish soldiers – roam each location making Brian's task of getting these objects difficult. Up to three objects can be carried at any one time, and they can be used to block the path of monsters or to make extra platforms. The objects do not fall when dropped, making it easier for Brian to leap across blank areas. Getting the correct objects in the correct places is a daunting task.

		<name>Mr. Wimpy</name>
		<desc>Mr. Wimpy is a one-player game, where the character controls Mr. Wimpy whose favorite hobby is making tasty hamburgers. In level one, you are required to bring back each ingredient (cheese, beef patty, and sausage) separately on each of the three trays provided. 

Once you have done this, you'll advance a level where the gameplay changes a la Burger Time. The object is to make four burgers, and you do this by running over ingredients including either cheese or lettuce, beef patties, and the two hamburger buns, to make them fall onto the level below you without coming in contact with evil onions, hot dogs, and egg yolks. If you are unfortunate enough to come in contact with these nasties, you'll lose one of your five lives, unless you sprinkle pepper on them. Note that you only have a limited supply of pepper, so to get more, you need to travel to the top level and get cups of coffee or sundaes that move around the screen. Another way to deal with these enemies is to wait until one of them gets under an ingredient, and squash them by running over the ingredient. They will get squashed only to get resurrected somewhere on the screen.

When the ingredients are at the bottom level and you run over them, they will drop onto one of the four burgers at the bottom of the screen. When you make all four burgers, you proceed to the next level. The more levels you proceed, the more difficult your quest is.

A small band of engineers has been dispatched to combat the Xeno threat before it takes over all the space stations and, eventually, your homeworld.  Assemble your band of engineers and fight the Xenos on each station, striving to either clear it or abandon it.  You start out with a standard issue laser, but can pick up additiona weapons as you find them, including Phasers, Lightning Rifles, Poofer guns, and bombs.

Xenophobe was originally an arcade coin-op by Bally/Midway, released in 1987.  Gameplay premise and setting is heavily inspired/influenced by the movie Aliens.

If you touch a proton thruster, an acid drop touches you in your acid vulnerable form, you overload you psyche, your psyche goes to zero or you're too low when you drop a bomb, you die.

		<name>Sim City</name>
		<desc>SimCity sets you as the mayor of a new municipality, with the responsibility of building and maintaining a place where citizens can move to and work and be happy. The first task is to place essentials such as housing, transport links, schools, factories and shops. There are 50 types of these, allowing for homes of all standards and different types of businesses. Make sure to consider which sites are effective for which tasks. Some power sources pollute, others don't but are more expensive. Taxes must be raised to ensure an income, and then portions allocated to public services such as policing and roads. Earthquakes, floods and fires are all emergency situations that must be dealt to contain any damage.

Successful mayoring will cause the small village to grow into a town, then a city and finally a metropolis. As the city's size grows so do it's needs. Commercial buildings may suddenly find that they need an airport to expand trade, or housing may find itself changing rapidly as vast amounts of people come and leave.

The game also includes 8 pre-defined time-limited scenarios, with specific challenges and targets. The environment varies in each game (especially if you have the Terrain Editor add on), and this should affect your choices.

Each level must be completed within a time limit, but progressing from left to right. She is armed with a whip, a useful weapon for attacking the denizens of dinosaurs on each level. Lots of bonus items can also be whipped to activate them - bonus lives and extra time for example. Tokens to turn into a fox can also be collected - enough of these takes you into a bonus level set underground.

		<desc>Gary Lineker's Hot-Shot! is a soccer game in which two teams try to win the match. The adjustable options are the number of players, the time of a half time and the AI level. The game is played in a top-down view and only shows a part of the playfield.

The player either controls the athlete in ball possession or, when in defense, the one which is nearest. When shooting, the power of the shot depends on how long the button was pressed and the direction changes with the joystick movement, e.g. moving against the walking direction results in a overhead kick.</desc>

		<name>Short Circuit</name>
		<desc>A freak bolt of lightning has made Robot 5 gain human feelings, and his makers at Nova Robotics are keen to open him up and find out how this happened. 5 therefore feels desperate to escape, and survive in the wider world.

The game is split into two parts, which differ from the Commodore 64 game of the same name, and can each be played independently. The first is viewed in third-person 3D, as our hero moves from room to room through various doors. Objects can be picked up to allow him to jump and fire. You can use objects in your possession, take them by searching desks, or link to some of the available computers to use their functionality.

In the second stage, armed with jumping and shooting abilities, Number 5 must simply escape as quickly as he can. Guards and Other robots are giving chase, and should be shot. Your robot becomes increasingly depressed when he kills wildlife, and this can eventually cost you a life, so make sure you jump or duck around them.

This is an adaption of the motion picture Masters of the Universe. You, as He-Man, must find the eight chords to the Cosmic Key. Along the way, you must fight Skeletor's minions. First, you fight in the streets and try to find a chord hidden in the streets. After you enter the scrapyard, you will meet and fight Blade and Karg to the death in a hand to hand beat 'em up to get another key. In Charlie's Electronics Store, you aim your cross-hair to shoot oncoming enemies who guard a chord. Later, make your way to the rooftops and fight a laser battle on a flying disk. After all eight chords are retrieved, go mano-a-mano with Skeletor in the final battle.

		<desc>Jorund, king of the Vikings, and father of our protagonist, has fallen for the deceits of Loki, Viking God of the lie. This deceit had as consequence the confinement of Jorund in the kingdom of Lukx, from where nobody has ever returned.

Because of this deceit the Viking king has profaned the prohibited garden of the Norns. In there are found a great part of the treasure that the Gods keep jealous, as well as some of the nymphs more beautiful than ever a human eye has contemplated.

Before such attractiveness, Jorund fell for the deceit of Loki and profaned the garden. The wrath of the Gods fell on him and their punishment did not take long: they would border to him to perpetuity to the kingdom of Lukx, where their inhabitants would give good account of the bones of our protagonist.

But Hundra was not resigned to that her father died in that exile, and therefore, could not reach Valhalla, paradise of the viking warriors.

Decided to change the fate of her father, she went to the Viking Mount Olympus where she convinced the Gods that her father had been deceived. They admitted their mistake, and saw that the punishment had been excessive; but their decisions were irrevocable and there was no way to save Jorund from his terrible end. Hundra offered to go to the kingdom of Lukx, and gather three sacred gems, stolen a long time ago from the Gods, to rescue her father.

		<name>Colour Clash</name>
		<desc>Colour Clash is based on Amidar, and named after the Spectrum ‘feature’ whereby moving colours don’t correctly fit the objects as they move. Through four stages (two competitive ones, alternated with bonus stages) the player must fight off an invasion of alien paint pots, and you only have a pot and a few grenades to fight back. 

The player is presented with a network of interconnected lines, and must move over every line. When a rectangle has been completely enclosed, it will change colour. During this phase you must avoid contact with the many alien pots, but have a limited number of grenades to clear the screen of them. Once the screen is completely filled, you have a limited amount of time to hit them for bonus points. Level 3 is similar to this, except that any outstanding lines to fill a box must be completed in sequence; leaving the square will blank the lines out.

Level 2 is a one-press bonus game - a properly-timed press will guide an arrow down a network of lines into the specified point, for a points boost. Level 4 is a Light Cycles game – block the lines (which represent attacking pots) by using your trail to shut the space on the screen, leaving them with nowhere to move. After level 4 is completed, the game cycles through the four levels again, with increased difficulty.

		<desc>Your task in Extreme essentially involves wiping out alien pirates, across 3 distinct sections. This was essentially a spare-time pet project, so you would expect some of the most advanced graphics and special effects you'll ever see on a Spectrum.

The first level involves flying around in a ship shooting out aliens, with contact depleting your energy (and causing the screen border to flash). The second section involves travelling underwater, running into landmines to set off explosions to kill surrounding enemies. The final part sees you travelling through a  building in a huge droid, taking out everything in your path. The game is quite short, and would take around 20 minutes to play through.

		<name>Magnetron</name>
		<desc>Magnetron was a follow-up to Quazatron.

Robot KLP-2 returned to destroy a series of space stations around the planet Quartech. This was achieved by overloading or shutting down the four nuclear reactors in each station. KLP-2 had to carry nuclear fuel rods between the reactors, with each rod having a positive or negative charge and a weight. The more weight being carried, the slower KLP-2 moved and the harder it was to get up slopes. The charge affected how the robot reacted to arrow tiles on the floor - a positive charge would move the robot in the direction of the arrow, a negative charge in the opposite direction.

Throughout the space station were computer screens to give information, in a very similar method to Paradroid. Enemies came in various types and had different weapons, with each showing a rank and droid number on the front. By standing still and holding down fire, KLP-2 entered grapple mode. Now he could run into an enemy and try to take control. This gave a 9x9 grid of symbols. Rearranging the bottom row disarmed the detonator and allowed KLP-2 to steal energy for a recharge. Rearranging all three rows allowed KLP-2 to take over the other robot and use its abilities and weapons.

Once at the reactor, KLP-2 could add or remove a rod at a time. The aim was either to overload (by getting a big positive number) or shut down (by getting a big negative number). With all four reactors shut down, the lights dimmed and KLP-2 went to a beam pad to move on to the next station.

		<desc>The original commercially-licensed version of Alexey Pajitnov's classic Tetris puzzle game.  Geometric shapes fall from the top of a playfield to rest on the bottom; fit the pieces together, and the line they form disappears.  If the pieces don't form lines and eventually stack up to the top of the playfield, the game is over.  Difficulty increases by dropping the pieces faster and faster over time.

Tetris is a verifiable classic game, translated to well over 200 electronic and computer platforms.  It takes 2 minutes to learn, but a lifetime to master.

		<name>Bomb Jack</name>
		<desc>In Bomb Jack, the player controls Jack, who must collect all the bombs in order to complete the current round and go onto the next one. This sounds easy, right? Wrong! Making Jack's task difficult are numerous enemies such as birds, mummies, turtles, and orbs.

In each round, collecting a number of bombs results in a bonus coin appearing, and collecting this coin will make the player's score increase 2 to 4 times. More often than not, the "power ball" appears, and when you collect this, you can defeat enemies and have more time to collect all the bombs. There is also the "E" coin, which gives Jack one additional life, but rarely does this coin appear.

The more you progress through the game, the more difficult it becomes, as enemies travel more quickly to get you.

		<name>Thunderbirds</name>
		<desc>International Rescue is made up of George Tracy, Brains Hackenback, and Tracy's five sons, each of whom has a Thunderbird craft of their own. They have four missions to complete in turn.

Each of these involves a two-man squad, whom you can switch between at any time. Each must select the correct objects to bring beforehand. You will have to move through the screens via lifts and ladders, avoid hazards and solve puzzles.

Mission one is set in a mine shaft, which is rapidly flooding and has two miners trapped. Next up is a nuclear submarine stranded after hitting a mine, which must be repaired and reactivated before it explodes. During this mission, you discover evidence of the miner's construction, so must break into a bank to steal the appropriate documents. This reveals that a madman is holding International Rescue to ransom, so you must finally travel to his lair to stop him.

Sid must navigate a series of platforms while jumping over robots that guard the keys. Once Sid collects all the keys, he can make his way to the next level by going through a doorway. Like his father, Sid has a limited time to perform this task, and he loses one of his lives if he fails to collect all of them, or if he falls long distances.

		<name>Who Dares Wins II</name>
		<desc>Eight invaded townships must be brought back under your control in this Commando-style shoot 'em up, which progresses vertically using a flick-screen system. You are armed with a rifle (activated by a short tap of the fire button) and five grenades (used via a longer press), and must not only kill off the enemy forces, but also rescue your comrades who have been tied to trees along the way. You begin at the bottom of the first screen and slowly make your way upwards; enemies pop up from all sides, walking around and shooting, and you have to dodge their shots while trying to shoot them yourself. The foes make good use of the decoy opportunities of the terrain, and you must do the same to have a chance. The levels include rivers with narrow bridges, potholes, and train-lines.

Extra supplies are dropped in as you progress through the game, as are extra lives in addition to your starting 5.

This game gives you the chance to play this, either against a friend or the computer. The action is viewed top-down, with a slight angle giving a 3D effect, which is especially noticeable when the ball is in the air. You control the player nearest to the ball, including the goalkeeper once the ball reaches the 6-yard area, and can pass or shoot from any distance. The length of the match can be altered, as can the colour of the pitch.

It is an adaptation of "Punch &amp; Judy": you are the hunchback Bobby, your goal is to make your way across sixteen theater stages to rescue the beautiful Judy from the Punch. Each stage is filled with the typical hazards of a traditional play, like crocodiles, custard pies and rotten tomatoes, as well as the pits that must be crossed via moving platforms. You'll sometimes have the chance to catch a sausage flying around in the air as you move along.

Even though it is a rather early game, the Spectrum version features some interesting speech samples using a technique that was very uncommon at that time.

		<name>Genghis Khan</name>
		<desc>Genghis Khan is basically a strategy game, but not just. A very important part of your ability as governor will depend on your arcade experience when it comes to conquering the territories surrounding Mongolia. You mission will be to invade the Chinese Empire, and for that you must tear down the Great Wall using gunpowder.

Unfortunately it will not be available from the beginning, so you will have to conquer Baghdad where the secrets of gunpowder manufacture are kept, and then dedicate your task in destroying the barrier that prevents you from the victory. But it will not be that easy, you will also have to defeat several enemies of varying difficulty.

The game makes you choose between arcade, strategy or a mixture of both. In the first category you must use the joystick to defeat the owner of the chosen land. The screen turns into a side-scrolling game in which a Mongol warrior, sword in hand, must face the enemy hordes. Each soldier you kill equalizes to five in total, and every blow you receive means a loss of five units of yours.

		<desc>Turbo Esprit puts you in control of a Lotus Esprit cop car, with the challenge of breaking up a drugs gang and protecting the innocent.

A map is built into the car, which can instantly show the positions of the baron's cars - this is crucial because you can't interrupt them before the initial deal is done, as this will simply make them leave and try again another time.

The game's environment is large and varied, with traffic lights, junctions and zebra crossings accurately implemented, and pedestrians to avoid. The roads are multi-laned, and at the end of each road you can turn across, which makes the game's perspective shift in a flick-screen manner. One unusual feature for the time is a saveable high-score table.

		<name>Mag Max - Robo Centurion</name>
		<desc>An alien menace has attacked the worlds of civilization and laid waste to their planets. However before the being conquered, a group of scientists has managed to create one last weapon and hidden it underground. The name of the weapon is Mag Max and only it might be able to defeat the alien invaders. Mag Max however is incomplete and for security reasons, his component parts are scattered across the land. Through their collection, Mag Max's strength increases.

Mag Max is a side-scrolling shooter game. At the beginning, Mag Max is only a tiny little fighter craft that can fire low-powered projectiles. As component pieces are found; such as a head, legs and a laser lance, Mag Max's offensive power increases. Access to the underworld can be granted through small dark craters on the landscape. Once in the underworld, Mag Max's weapons vary slightly as do the enemies (there are no stationary objects underground). Enemy fire or contact on each of the components will destroy that component. Fire on the main fighter will destroy Mag Max. At the end of each level awaits a boss creature.

		<desc>Silkworm is a classic horizontally-scrolling shoot-em-up based on the 1988 Tecmo arcade game. The main difference between this game and many other side-scrolling shoot-em-ups is that you got to be on land as well as in the air.

Player 1 would play as a helicopter, but if a second player joined the game, they would play as a jeep. Both players would have to protect each other as well as themselves. After a certain number of kills, a "goose" helicopter would form on the screen. If the players managed to destroy it they would get a weapons powerup. This would go on throughout the entire game (a "goose" could appear even during the end of level baddie!).

Now one day, Berk, along with his friend Drutt, decided to explore his domain by going through the Trap Door.

You take control of both Drutt and Berk, swapping between them with the fire button. They need to solve a series of puzzles and deal with new creatures along the way. There are four regions to explore, and opening locked doors give access to later regions. Scattered throughout the regions are sweets and toadstools which, when consumed, will provide Berk with special characteristics. Progress is made by using the two characters together, as Drutt can reach places that Berk cannot.

		<desc>Side-scrolling beat 'em ups in which you must rescue a trapped female friend are nothing unusual. Being able to use direct-combat moves as well as collecting bonus weapons, and food for energy recharging, is pretty typical as well. Games of this type that were converted from the arcade to home computers are particularly commonplace - Renegade and the Double Dragon series are famous examples.

Where this one stands out, however, is the setting of your character as a duck called Bin, and with motion having a clear waddling appearance. The enemies to fight are all from the animal kingdom, but somewhat warped - crocodiles with boxing moves and cows armed with rocket packs for example. Bin has six levels to clear before he can rescue Lucy from Archaca's clutches.

The player can speed up or slow down the balls, or control their height, to make it easy to avoid these hazards. If all four balls have been punctured, the player loses a life. Once all ten balloons have been collected, the player is transported to the next environment, and when they have managed to get through all twelve environments, the player is transported back to the first environment.

		<name>Mutants</name>
		<desc>In the distant future, human beings have outposts all over the galaxies, but wars and aggression have not died out. Neither has opposition to potential exploitation or environmental damage; your resistance movement has discovered that Macro-Genetic Mutoids (Mutants) are being bred purely to be used as weapons. 

Controlling the familiarly-named Rainbow Warrior in this top-view shooter, you must fly to each of the 15 mutant-breeding zones, collecting their self-destruct pods, and taking all of these to the control room. You are armed with missiles, torpedos and a shield, and can use one of these at a time. The control zone is hazardous, and any contact is destructive, but reaching its target will recharge your three lives; thus, it can be worth doing this before you have completed all 15 zones.

The gameplay element of having short levels with a single specific target to account for resembles Hunter's Moon.

		<desc>As a deep sea diver, you sense an opportunity to gain untold wealth from the large number of treasures which have drifted to the bottom of the ocean. You do this by attaching yourself to your diving station and moving down the infested waters, grabbing an item of treasure and moving it back up to the station.

Various fish are around, including crabs, piranhas and squids, all of which move in their own ways, and can be shot with your gun. Worst of all are the sharks which can cut through your cord - make sure they do not swim above you close to the line. The cord can go through other fish safely and unimpeded, but contact with the fishes themselves costs you a life. You have 32 screens to plunder.

		<desc>A conversion of the arcade game of the same name, which itself is loosely based on a movie, Kung-Fu Master is a side scrolling action game for one or two players, who alternate turns.

Mr. X has captured the pickpocket Sylvia and it is up to Thomas, a kung-fu master who owns a restaurant, to get her back. She is located on the top floor of Mr. X's castle and Thomas will need to fight his way to the top. Of course, this won't be easy as each floor has many opponents to get past and a floor boss at the end of each level. 

Thomas is able to move left and right, jump, duck, and punch and kick. Enemy projectiles such as knives can be kicked in the air to rebound them towards the enemy. On the top floor resides Mr. X himself.

It is possible to play just one match or a tournament. In tournament mode the player can select which grand slam to play: the Australia Open, Roland Garros, Wimbledon, and the US Open.

The player can select their opponent from a list of famous tennis players, such as Lendl, Becker, Wilander, Edberg, or McEnroe.

The game follows standard tennis rules and allows the player to hit a variety of forehand and backhand shots to any location on the court.

		<desc>As in Stormlord, you must rescue as many fairies as possible, on this occasion by catching them out of the sky as they fall. This isn't as easy as it sounds, because this scrolling platform shooter has many sections in which the fairies are falling towards fiery pits, and you must catch them without hitting this pit. 

The controls allow you to jump, and then jump again while falling, so you can, with effort, climb most of the way up the screen. The forces of the Black Queen are out to stop you, including spiders, bats and goblins, and even the clouds and stalactites on the ceilings launch deadly droplets of distilled doom. A bonus level is offered sporadically, allowing you to collect coins for extra lives - although you start with 9, you'll need them, as the levels are long and treacherous.

He can move along each ledge, and must avoid holes which open, as they can cause him to drop further. Later levels add aliens, snakes and all manner of other hazards, as well as an increasing number of holes. The control combination is unusual, and only comfortable on earlier Spectrum models - the game has no joystick mode.

Controls involve moving a pointer over the square to move a piece from, pressing space, then moving to the destination square and pressing space again. You can set the amount of time players (human and computer) have to plan moves, although an over-ride option to force a move instantly also exists. You can save and reload games, and at any point can move pieces either from current settings or from scratch, to completely customise the game or play out classic positions.

		<name>3D Combat Zone</name>
		<desc>3D Combat Zone is a 1st-person tank hunting game which takes place on a vast plain scattered with pyramids. It transports the player into the valleys of Lacentra, now a battlefield occupied with the spoils of a centenary war battled between two opposite factions. The player is in charge of commanding a special tank and the only left from a vanquished fleet.

The solitary vehicle is equipped with a radar system and provided with a mighty cannon loaded with heavy piercing shells. The cannon is reloaded every time one of the shells hits something or goes through the maximum possible distance. It faces the remnant of the enemy fleet which still commands three types of vehicles: normal tanks, hovering saucers and super tanks.

This game belongs to the pioneering group of games designed for Spectrum which started to use the 3D wire frame technology effectively, maximizing the use of limited resources on an 8 bit machine and structurally inspired by Battlezone.</desc>

		<desc>To finally get rid of the vicious Seiddab, a crack pilot has been cloned 15 times, to produce an army of warriors each with their own spacecraft. In this multi-section game you must plan, co-ordinate and fulfil this attack.

You start off aboard a ship, in the home sector of Sol, and must go to the navigation computer to choose a sector to enter - the number of Seiddab it contains is indicated. Once there, the action is a side-scrolling shoot 'em up on a looping Defender-style playfield, with rocks to avoid as well as the Seiddab. Leaving via the portal you used to enter takes you back to the navigational screen.

However, many sectors also contain Seiddab bases (which look like pylons). Enter one of these and another game section begins, this time an arcade adventure set within the base. Each star-base has its own way to be destroyed using the objects you'll find and manipulate, and you'll have to work this out as well as shooting any Seiddab you do find.

		<desc>Tenpin Challenge was a budget choice for ten-pin bowling enthusiasts to play the game at home. Up to four players can take part, with a choice of five ball weights. The computer does the scoring automatically, taking bonus points for strikes and spares into account. Your high scores can be saved to cassette.

Taking a shot has three stages. First you must aim the shot  by moving a cursor left and right. then, you must set the spin, by stopping a spinning diagram as it quickly moves through the 360 degrees. Finally you set the pace, by holding down the 'a' key for the right length of time, with no power gauge to guide you. Once this is done you will see the shot outcome, with a split screen showing the ball moving sideways at first, and then towards (and hopefully into) the bunch of pins, which are then moved and replaced as necessary.

		<desc>Scorpio was one of the most beautiful space colonies of all the galaxy and its raw materials were one of the fundamental points of the terrestrial wealth. But, one day, the explosion of a Supernova altered the genes of the inhabitants of the planet, turning them into strange beings who hate the human specie and want to destroy it. In such a situation, the Earth space services sent a series of scientists in order to study the mutation and the way for solving it. But they were captured and forced to work for the scorpians in the creation of a definitive weapon that would make disappear our planet of the Solar System. Only a Rainbow-Command could avoid it and your help will be indispensable for the attainment of the mission.

The game is composed of two parts, within which there are two introduction sub-games that will allow you to obtain some additional lives before starting the game itself. On the first part you will have to face a series of natural obstacles while shooting to everything with strange looks, for that, you count with a laser and a cosmic hammer, but you also should take batteries for your portable radar that informs to you of the enemy situation. 

Once finished this part, you will start the last one, in which you must be careful in not crashing your newly-acquired motorcycle with the multiple obstacles you will find, at the same time you get rid of the mutants, whereas you go to the laboratory where you will have to liberate the kidnapped scientists.  It won't be easy - you will find the head of the mutants who is anxious to give you a warm welcome.

The game features a full practice mode as well as qualifying and races. There are only 8 computer bikes, although the real life championship points system is used, meaning that the penalty for not finishing is bigger than in real life, especially as you only have 5 bikes to last the season. The game is viewed from overhead, and the controls are, unusually, direction based, so to take a straight which (in the overhead view) involves going up and to the right, you must push the joystick in that direction.

However, it is rumored that Gideon is being held captive in the evil clutches of Domir – for only Gideon himself can unite the Clans of the Reaches and prevent Dolmir's intended domination. Piradon, a great magician, has the task of rescuing Gideon, but accomplishing this task will be most difficult as his magical powers are limited in the lands he is about to journey.

Majik is a first-person adventure where players must perform certain tasks in order to proceed through the game. The four arrow icons allow movement in any direction (N, S, E, or W), and can turn either white or red. If the icon is white, the player can travel in that direction, otherwise the icon is red. Next to the arrows is another icon, and selection this will present players with several verbs such as VIEW, LOOK, SEARCH, and SLEEP. Any objects and people are displayed in the OBJECT and PEOPLE window, respectively.

St. Dragon the Cyborg Warrior chooses to fight back against this tyranny, and that is the role you take in this horizontally scrolling shoot 'em up.

Five R-Type-style levels await, with a wide variety of weapons on offer. When you lose a life (even your last life; there are continues on offer as well) you don't lose any of your power-up weaponry, but the restart points are quite far apart. The game's main unique feature is the armoured tail you have, which can be used to ward off attackers and can do considerable damage on its own if well-used.

		<name>Nigel Mansell's Grand Prix</name>
		<desc>Nigel Mansell's first licensed computer game recreates all 16 Formula 1 circuits of the time, viewed from behind the car but with a full cockpit-type view below. This is important because the game is very much a simulation rather than an action game.

Before each race you have to do three qualifying laps, and only make the grid if you are fast enough to meet the pre-defined qualifying limit. The races can be between 5 and 20 laps, or at full length if you prefer - fortunately a half-finished season can be saved to cassette or disk. 

F1 cars of this era have turbo boosts, and this is available in the game to provide a quick blast of extra speed, which is useful for overtaking but can cause the turbo or the engine itself to be overstressed, as well as using fuel more quickly (pitstops are for tires but not fuel, again in keeping with the era's real Formula 1 rules).

		<desc>Throughout the known universe, a lifestyle of constant education and minimal pleasure is being enforced by the System. The Wanglers are the main group of rebels to this, and their leader Brains has been imprisoned in the empire's compound. A team of four Wanglers, each with distinct characteristics with affect gameplay - the flying Mobod and Xann, climbing expert Magno, and the bouncing Spex - come to the rescue

The compound is split into 512 screens, and you can switch between the four characters when you come to a teleport. Each has limited battery power for the special suits which protect them - fortunately this can be recharged. There are plenty of guards to take out

Unfortunately, his van has broken down, so he must do his rounds on foot. The first job is to find a collect the pile of letters. Watch out for stray hens. Make sure to drink plenty of tea to ensure that he is up to the tasks.

That is not all he must do though - being a pillar of the community he is always prepared to help out when his friends need a favour. These may involve collecting and using objects (only one can be carried at a time), or finding other people such as Ted Glenn the handyman. A top-down map guides you as you complete each task.

The former ruler's castle Avars is shrouded in mystery, and Isvar chooses to investigate it. Unfortunately, he finds himself trapped in a mysterious castle from which he must escape.

Viewed isometrically, Isvar's adventure features complex object manipulation: each object has its own physical properties and resultant characteristics in terms of how much else can be carried alongside it. The castle is guarded and full of trolls, who can weaken Isvar's energy - food and wine can restore it.

		<name>H.A.T.E. - Hostile All Terrain Encounter</name>
		<desc>Hostile All-Terrain Encounters await in this shoot 'em up notable for it's unusual diagonal scroll, which is similar to Costa Panayi's previous Highway Encounter series. As nobody is qualified to take the enemy on, your task is to complete the 30 levels of training (the actual war could've been the basis for a sequel, although this never happened).

The levels alternate between controlling a Star Fighter plane and a Ground Assault Vehicle; the latter is faster but is confined to ground motion. The plane can move up and down to make dodging the simulated enemy fire easier. This generally comes at you in waves, although there are also ground installations.

Central to the game is to shoot at the cases of plasma crystals, and then fly over these so as to carry them to the end of the level. Dying loses you one of these crystals if you have at least one, or a life if you do not. Completing a level with at least 2 crystals is effectively a restart point as well, as when you die you are sent back to a level in which you collected at least 2.

		<desc>One of the earliest person-licensed computer games, Olympic legend Daley Thompson lent his name to an old-style joystick waggling frenzy. Ten events were featured, including long and high jumps as well as the predictable sprints, which made for some gameplay variety. You have 3 lives, and lose one every time you fail at an event, which you usually get 3 attempts at. For each event you see both the qualifying time and the world record, which gives you something to aim at.

		<name>Witch's Cauldron, The</name>
		<desc>The Witch's Cauldron is a text adventure with graphics where the protagonist is turned into a slimy toad by the witch Hazel, apparently inspired by the classic fairy tale The Frog King. Imprisoned on the witch's island, the player needs to get the main character back to his original form by collecting ingredients and mixing them into the cauldron, with complementary adventure game puzzles.

During the game, the player will transform into various creatures, such as a bat, a cat or an ape, while trying to regain the human form. The screen has been divided horizontally in a graphic representation of the scene (top) and a lower part for the text description and commands. The scenes are not shown from a first-person perspective. Instead, the player is able to see its form in a third-person view from the side, showing the current location in relation to the objects.

There are about 100 rooms to explore and some puzzles require a specific form. If a shape change happens to quickly, it becomes possible to miss out on items.

My boy, you'll be locked in the Castle with no name. You've to survive the nightmare world inside... and escape alive! Others have tried without success, and were sadly transformed into ogres by the evil mage Nirlem. Good luck!

This was one of the first games by Dinamic. It's a challenging side-scrolling game with Ghosts N' Goblins style gameplay, with some strange monsters (you know, the Castle was previously owned by Alucard!) and potions that can help you a bit. By the way... you can climb ropes, and will frequently need to.

		<desc>Shadow Warriors is a direct port of the arcade version of Ninja Gaiden. It is a beat'em up in the veins of Double Dragon featuring Ryu Hayabusa, a ninja who must fight members of an evil cult who seek to fulfil Nostradamus' end of the world prophecies.

Ryu Hayabusa can attack his enemies using his his bare hands and feet or using a sword (for a limited time). He can also perform moves such as a flying neck throw, a back flip and hang kicks, performed while hanging in scenario objects. Throwing enemies against objects such as phone cabins, oil drums or dumpsters will destroy them, revealing power ups such as health items and swords. At some points, Ryu will have to perform acrobatic moves to carry on. He has a life bar starting with 5 units.

The game takes place in United States' locations such as Las Vegas, North Carolina, Los Angeles, the Grand Canyon and Brooklyn. The enemies in those stages are mostly of the same 5 kinds, including Jason Vorhees' look-alikes and other masked men. There is a boss fight at the end of each stage.

A two-player co-operative game is also featured. Whenever the player dies, a continue screen will appear showing Ryu chained to a table while a circular saw descends upon him.

Following the successes over Targ's Central City, the controller of the BENSON computer relaxes and enjoys himself. Soon however, he grows bored and starts looking around for new challenges on the still hazardous Planet Targ. Rumors about the Palyar Commander's brother-in-law living in the southern hemisphere suggest that this may be a good challenge. In this Second City, the battle between Palyars and Mechanoids still rages... and nothing is as it seems.

		<desc>The streets of Los Angeles are not safe. Lately, the kids are sick and tired of parents ordering them about and telling them what to do, so they decide to go out on the streets and threaten to club every policeman who gets in their way, making the streets not safe for the public, not even for little old ladies who decide to take a walk on a sunny day.

The bad news is: you're a police officer patrolling the streets, and you have two other police officers at your side. Your job is to shoot the little troublemakers that approach you. These troublemakers are harmless at a distance, but they are known to throw fire bombs at a few policemen. When you are killed by one of the troublemakers, one of the policemen replaces you as the one who gets to control the streets. If there is no policemen left, the game is over.

There are also turret guns located on top of buildings that fire, so you just can't stay on the footpath and hope not to get clobbered by the troublemakers. You just have to cross the road which is dangerous for a policeman in situations like this. When you come to the intersection, you'll come face-to-face with a gang, and you must shoot each gang member before they have a chance to leave you for dead. Once you've shoot all remaining gang members, a man appears holding a woman hostage. The object here is to shoot the man to free her. If you shoot the woman instead, you'll sacrifice 1000 points.

Your score increases when you walk, but score more points if you manage to shoot a troublemaker. You'll lose 100 points for killing a lady walking down the footpath.

Gameplay has remained pretty much the same, with each screen presenting a side view of obstacles to get past, and potentially treasures to collect. The landscape is more maze like, with a variety of paths and dead ends to search. Along the way there are checkpoints the player will encounter. When the player dies, Pitfall Harry will be sent back to the most recently crossed checkpoint.

		<name>Battle Valley</name>
		<desc>This side-view shoot 'em up involves trying to retrieve two nuclear weapons which have been stolen by terrorists. These are located at opposite ends of the playing area, so you can pursue them in either order. Needless to say, the terrorists have plenty of forces out to prevent you getting too far.

Unusually, the game features both a helicopter and a tank - you choose either from the base, and can fly/drive back there to change. The best strategy is to use the helicopter to shoot out air-based enemies and repair the various bridges, then return for the tank. You get 4000 seconds in which to complete all this, and losing a life costs you 500 of these.

		<desc>Spike wishes to find the fabled Magic Dream Sphere, which will make his every wish come true. As such, he must journey through the mysterious and treacherous caverns of the land of Golden Dreams.

Gameplay is platform based, in the style of Manic Miner. Each screen consists of a network of bridges, with precise placement and careful planning usually more important than quick reactions, especially as Spike can't be controlled mid-jump. Keys must be collected and switches toggled en route. Once Spike has retrieved the Orb, he must travel back through the screens with it, ensuring that it remains under his control.

		<desc>A bomb has been set by terrorists to blow up a sky-scraping hotel in which the FBI’s Central Intelligence Unit is located, and you must diffuse it. 
Reaching the room itself is no easy task, as the hotel is split into segments of 8 floors, and you can’t move onto the next one without the emergency key, which the porter has hold of – he must be located. Each of these has one eighth of the secret stop code, and these must be entered in order to finally diffuse the bomb. Secrets can be gleaned from the opposing hijackers, and from the barman. In some cases furniture can be used to your advantage. 
The whole game is similar to Impossible Mission, requiring lots of logic, puzzle-solving and structured thought.

Mr. James Sydney has just been shot in the head. The assassin, who fired from the opposite building, should know the habits of the victim, because (s)he spent all the day at the same place there... So you go with your team to the crime scene to collect the clues and follow the possible traces.

The game as its predecessor flows in two parts: crime scene investigation to collect the evidence, and work with telex machine to gain information about possible suspects.

The crime scene now includes two screens (street with Sydney's body and assassin's apartment). You should collect all possible evidence moving the marker on the screen and examining the objects scattered at the scenes as well as the body itself.

With telex machine you should perform investigation according to the police procedures. Different actions are possible here such as sending messages within Diamond Network to receive the replies, printing the notes, contacting other Police services to gain the new information, comparing the evidences, carrying out examinations such as autopsy, interviewing/checking the alibis of suspects, and arresting finally. To specify the subject for each action you should type it.

The 'Dark Fusion' of the title refers to a game element where, after completing part of the game the player, who is a member of the elite Corps of Guardian Warriors, must choose whether to fuse themselves with there vanquished foe or continue with only their mortal powers.

There are four levels in the game and each level is divided into three zones - Combat zone, Alien zone, and the Flight zone. In the Combat zone the player starts out as a warrior in a space suit. Scrolling to the right there are numerous aliens that have to be shot / bypassed in order to reach the end of the level. Some aliens as they perish leave behind power ups which are essential to progressing through the game.

The player must enter and kill all the aliens in two Alien Zones in order to complete the Combat zone, then they must fight their way to the Flight Zone fusion pod to become a space ship and fly through to the next level.</desc>

		<path>./Zybex (Europe).tzx</path>
		<name>Zybex</name>
		<desc>Zybex is a horizontally scrolling shoot 'em up inspired by Side Arms and Nemesis/Gradius. The players took control of prisoners trying to win freedom from a galactic prison. At the end of each level they earned a crystal, opening access to the later levels of the game.

There are 16 levels in total, with numbers 2-12 immediately available after completing the first - the player can go through them in any order. However, levels 13-16 are locked until the player earns enough crystals.

The weapon system is quite unique - the player constantly fires, and the fire button is simply used to change the current weapon. The basic weapon is the Orbiter, which the player always has. Picking up weapon icons increases the power of a weapon by 1 up to the maximum of power level 4. Dying reduces the current weapon by 1 power level, or loses it if the weapon is power 1 (with the exception of the Orbiter). As the weapons get more power, their fire rate becomes faster and the bullets stronger. The five weapons are Orbiter, 8-way (upgrades from 2 to 4 to 6 to 8 way fire), Railgun (powerful single bullet which gets longer) Pulse (fires straight forward and gains diagonal fire at power 3/4) and Wall (another forward fire, which gains size).

Each of the moves scores a different number of points and if you come last in a particular round you are eliminated.

There are some sub-games too, involving your karate-master holding a shield and defending himself against bouncing balls from both directions, and kicking bombs off the screen before they explode.

All in the pursuit of that elusive black belt...

Gameplay is side-view and takes place on a number of vertical levels, with a feel similar to Green Beret. Jump and duck to target and avoid crooks. Later you spend time inside a car, and can lean out of the window to shoot people. Watch out for enemy cars, which can only be destroyed using grenades.

		<name>Toyota Celica GT Rally</name>
		<desc>A detailed recreation of rallying licensed from Toyota Great Britain. Driving on gravel, asphalt and ice is involved, with each race made up of a series of short stages to complete. After each stage, your times are compared with those of your rivals, whose names are subtly changed from the real drivers of the day. Up to four human players can be involved, taking it in turns.

As visibility is sometimes low, and the exact curvature of a corner isn't always obvious from the apex, a co-driver is provided to give pace notes. These can be adjusted before you take to the track, specifying what is defined as 'hard left' and how early the warning should be given.

The steering sensitivity can be adjusted, and you can choose between automatic centering, and a push-the-opposite-way-to-centre mode, but more unusual is the option to race with the steering directions reversed - definitely one for advanced players.

		<desc>Eddie Murphy became a star in the police film Beverly Hills Cop, and it was this license that Tynesoft used to create a game featuring four distinct sub-games, each of which can be practiced from the main screen in some versions. First Axel Foley visits a warehouse to shoot out some bad guys in a Green Beret-influenced sequence.

The second level (first on the C64 version) involves driving after 3 lorries full of weapons, and shooting them out one by one, Chase HQ-style. Avoid contact and stay on the road to complete this. Next you must cross the grounds of a mansion, shooting anyone who gets in your way.

The final section is set within the mansion, and is first-person 3D, although with few movement angles and only one enemy on screen at a time.

Cosmica is full of hideous monsters, many of which can be shot. Your character builds momentum as it moves, so some hazards are easier to clear from a running start. You can only jump vertically, although you have control as the character falls. Ammunition is limited, and must be collected throughout your quest.

Three sweets which enhance your character can be collected - the red one increases your speed, blue increases the height of your leap, and green means you can safely fall further. There are additional objects to pick up and use as well.

The game is presented from an isometric perspective, and presents the characters with a number of puzzles involving switches, jumps and climbs. The levels are 3 dimensional, and the characters must collect crowns as they progress. Objects can be picked up and manipulated as necessary.

		<name>Turmoil</name>
		<desc>Bug Byte's Turmoil is a platform game starring Mick The Mechanic. 
He works for Sheik Abdul Al Kohol, the dictator of El Khazi, who is known for his fabulous car collection.
Because Sheik Abdul Al Kohol doesn't pay Mick The Mechanic to well - he's getting payed in sheep's eye balls - he is going to steel the sheiks cars.

To do that he has to collect oil for the car to make it drive off to the next screen. However, The sheiks cars are protected by fanatical and murderous Arabian bodyguards.

Mick has to climb on and of ladders to collect the oil in his oil can and when the can is full pouring it down the grid into the car. Mick can also spill a drip of oil to let an Arabian bodyguard slip (or himself if done wrong).
Tools that appear occasionally on various places on the screen will give special bonuses when these tools are collected and returned to the workshop.

The cars in the garage are not visible at first. When oil is poured into the grid the car becomes more and more visible. The car becomes fully visible when it is full of oil.

The game features 26 screens and each screen has a different maze-like lay-out that contains multiple hazards and obstacles like springboards, walls that disappear, conveyor belts, elevators and rope swings. The cars become more expensive when you progress in the game.

		<desc>O Blind Alley descreve um esporte que se passa quase um milênio a partir de agora, no qual você está no controle de uma espaçonave e deve derrotar as embarcações adversárias. A jogabilidade se assemelha ao jogo Tron Light Cycles, sendo jogado em uma grade, com mais e mais navios à medida que o jogo avança. Cada nave tem sua própria trilha de movimento, que permanece na tela durante o jogo, e uma rodada é perdida por um navio que atinge uma dessas trilhas ou na borda da tela. O controle é direcional e não rotacional; portanto, tentar reverter é fatal. Esta versão não possui o modo 2 jogadores, mas suporta os joysticks Kempston e roda em 16K de memória.</desc>

Using the power to cast rainbows, trapping anything underneath, the boys must ascend vertically 4 levels each island, with a big, bad boss at the end of each.

By trapping beasts under your rainbows, then jumping on them to break them you can collect seven different colored gems, and there are also power-ups for extra speed and rainbows.

		<desc>This is a top down vertically scrolling shooter, in which you start off as a motorbike. You are quite vulnerable to attack at first, but power ups come in the form of a Sega van which you have to dock with. The first time you dock you get double fire, the second time gives you a rocket, the third gives a rear force field and the fourth invulnerablility.

By destroying cars and bikes that appear on your way, you can collect A-F letters. Collecting A through to D allows you change into a sportscar which is less vulnerable to attack, but not as nimble. Collect all the letters in order to be able to transform into a high tech plane. This is the final stage of one of the five missions. Only the high tech plane can guide you to your destination in which your main target is hiding.

There is also time limit in which you have to complete the mission. It is advisable to transform into the high tech plane as fast as it is possible.

Picking up flags gives you bonus points with 10,000 points gaining you an extra life.

Plenty of beings are out there to stop him, and spells can be cast to vanquish these - your spell energy constantly restores, so finding quiet spaces to wait for it to recharge can be beneficial. By pushing down into the ground, you can turn into an eagle so as to fly across gaps, although activating this mode takes a bit of energy, and you can't use spells while eaglified. Pushing into the ground returns you to human form.

		<name>Cauldron II - The Pumpkin Strikes Back</name>
		<desc>An evil witch has brought evil and darkness to the enchanted wood, wiping out all but 1 of the innocent pumpkins. As the poem in the instructions sheet explains, the only way to put things right is to capture a lock of her hair, then take it to the cauldron and cast a spell to undo things.

Controlling the pumpkin is difficult at first, as it has a very high bounce, the exact level of which can be toggled using the 5 key. Direction can only be changed when the ball is on the ground. Ricocheting into enemies costs energy, and you only gain weaponry by landing into magic pools. The starting positions are random,  making mapping advisable and increasing the initial challenge.

Even then, enemies respawn quickly, so all you're doing is buying a little time to pass them. Others can't be shot, and must be passed by possessing the right object - possibly one of the 5 you will ultimately need to vanquish the witch.

There were up to 14 circuits depending on the format, which incorporated many underpasses (some of them deliberately unrealistic) and tight curves. There were oil slicks to avoid and points bonuses to pick up.

The cars have slow acceleration but a lot of power down the straights. You are scored based on your overall time and your fastest lap. Lose to the computer car and it's game over.

As you collect nectar, you must return to your honey pot to deposit it, He is limited in how much he can carry, and (unusually for a game of this vintage) is slowed down by carrying too much. Also, you must block off any bears to chase after your honey pot.

		<desc>An imaginative action game in which you must guide a ball-shaped craft through a succession of levels. These have a patchwork-quilt type display, with holes to avoid, and squares of various colors, which affect the craft's speed, both within its power potential and into warp, as well as a control-reverser and lots of holes. You can jump these holes by pressing fire, although you have a limited number of these for each level, and adjust the speed by pulling the joystick forward or backwards.  You face a time limit on each of the 21 levels, although your time is boosted every time you complete one. A simultaneous 2-player mode is included, similar to the split-screen mode in the Lotus games (by the same authors).

		<name>The Last Mission</name>
		<desc>The Last Mission is a side-view arcade game without scrolling (viewpoint moves from screen to screen) with map of big dimensions. The game takes its inspiration from games such as Underwurlde and Starquake.

You control a tank-like robot which can be divided in 
two: you rotate caterpillar and head-canyon, and the head part can fly off on its own. However,the head can only survive separately for a short amount of time, and your restart position is dictated by the location of the body, even if the head has moved forward through further screens. Therefore, the difficulty of the game was in making it possible to advance with the assembled robot's two parts.

		<name>Artura</name>
		<desc>Artura is a side-scrolling platform game.  The game semi-utilizes the mythology of King Arthur in that you play as Artura, son of the Pendragon.  Your goal is rescue Nimue, apprentice to Merdyn, from your evil half-sister Morgause.  

You will battle numerous horrible creatures such as spiders and bats with your axe and avoid deadly traps while attempting to gain access to Morgause's castle. You will also search for 6 runes, which contain spells, that you must find in order to free Nimue. Artura contains 4 maze-like levels that are so complicated that poster sized map of the levels is included with the game.

		<name>Highway Encounter</name>
		<desc>In this isometric 3D action-strategy game, the player uses a Vorton droid to push a bomb to the end of the highway into an alien base. There are 30 screens, most of them filled with hazards trying to block (like barrels) or destroy (mines and aliens) your bomb. 

The perspective and guidance concept are not the game's only original features; there are 4 more bombs with you, representing your extra lives - pushing you forward on your mission. If these other Vortons are destroyed, one of your extra lives is lost without the player being able to use it.

You can save on fuel costs by buying a fuel scoop and fly near the sun, but again, watch out for pirates! Or be a pirate yourself and raid other ships...  Don't get a bad rep as the police will come after you... Dock with space stations and do your trades (some may take contraband...) Upgrade your ship with your proceeds with better weapons,  shields, and other equipment. With 8 different galaxies, each with HUNDREDS of planets, there are plenty of room for exploration! Can you make your reputation all the way up to "elite"?

		<desc>This was Consult Computer Systems first major collaboration with Mike Singleton. It is a slash 'em up 1 or 2 player game in which you play one of 3 princes, each out to defeat his brothers and gain control of the castle. You can see the 2 players simultaneously side by side. 

You navigate to the different rooms by selecting the windows on the scrolling castle display on the bottom of the screen. These windows are colour coded to whichever prince controls that particular room. The rooms are displayed as a view from the window showing exits left, right and forward (which can move you up or down). There is a neat animation when a player dies showing blood dribbling down the screen.

You are racing against the clock, although there are lots of other bikes on track to avoid and ride around. There are 3 skill levels, which affect the amount of time you have to complete the level, and the bonus offered if you manage to (the amount of time left, divided by a set number, bigger on lower levels). Your bike has 3 gears and appears to have a top speed of around 120 MPH. After every 2 races there's a bonus round in which you must pick up as many tokens as possible in the time limit.

The game is platform viewed, although your character can move up and suspend at a particular level provided he has lots of fuel - fortunately pods of fuel are plentiful. Enemies patrol the screens, and there are lots of poisonous green patches to avoid - each cost you a life. Most screens have more than one exit, ensuring that a degree of exploration is required.

Lots of section are locked behind doors however, and the keys for these are not so plentiful. There are five different types of door - each of these has its corresponding key, although one of these requires 3 different pieces of key to be penetrated. A level designer is built in if you find the game too easy or too hard.

		<name>Dark Sceptre</name>
		<desc>The game's set in the Isles of the Western Sea, where the Lord of the Isles has made a big McCock-Up. He forged the Dark Sceptre to defeat the invading Northlanders, but they seized the Sceptre and absorbed its power, becoming the Lords of the Shadow. The isles are now gripped by evil and ruled by the Sceptre, and the forces of the Isles must find and destroy the Dark Sceptre itself.

There are seven teams of warriors roaming the Isles, each indicated by a colour. Umbrarg's Warriors are the Shadow Lords, and are red, while white marks your own team. The five sets of fighters in between should begin the game neutrally, and both you and the Shadow Lords can try to beat or befriend these warriors. As you think fit.

Each team is made up of men of various qualities, from Thanes to Thralls. The Thane is the team commander, without whom the entire company will be more readily defeated. A Thrall is a simple underling, a pawn in comparison to other more complex characters like Mystics, Heralds, Savages and Assassins. Each has its own style of headwear, such has crowns, turbans and helmets.

You have indirect control over your forces, able to tell them to scan an area for hostile warriors, keep an eye out for them, or carry out various orders. You can follow, protect, threaten or ambush warriors, use spells such as Charm and Petrify (turn to stone), or give or use objects.

Easier said than done, though - you will have to decide how much money to spend on money and how much to invest. And doing a good job might be bad for your health, since other organizations might hire hitmen to eliminate you.

The game features stylish graphics and is presented - not unlike King of Chicago - through conversations with other goons of your mob. And if you lose all your money or men, you will get the unforgettable message by your right-hand man... "What a schmuck you are, Mugsy."

		<desc>Sequel to Athena, the 2d side-scroller which starred a "kawaii" version of the greek goddess Athena as she set out to find adventure in the mortal world.

Changing her bikini for a Japanese schoolgirl uniform, Athena uses her new psychic powers (hence "psycho" soldier... erm... yep, anyway...) to clear a post-apocalyptic world of its mutant inhabitants with the help of her friend Kensu (thus allowing simultaneous 2 player gameplay).

Gameplay consists of the usual run 'n jump fare typical of the genre with the added feature of a constantly scrolling background, which added to the many "option"-style power-ups and Athena's own psychic blasts make the game a strange shooter/platformer hybrid.

If it lands  hazardous areas like spikes and sand, or hits the enemies which move around, one of the seven lives the player starts with is lost.

The basic objective is to pot all the balls, while failing to pot a ball in 3 shots will lose you the frame unless your opponent also fails to do this.

The game can be played by one or two players, with the one-player game consisting of a sequence of 20 different table layouts, each requiring its own style to win. Two-player games can take place on any of these layouts or one of your own design using the inbult table editor. Shot direction, speed and spin can be set on a general level.

		<name>Gremlins</name>
		<desc>Based on the movie of the same name, Gremlins: The Adventure is an interactive fiction game by Brian Howarth, author of the Mysterious Adventures series. Players take the role of Billy, who has already been tricked into feeding Gizmo after midnight, and now Kingston Falls is in danger of being overrun with Gremlins.  With Gizmo's help, Billy must save the town before it is too late.

There are some animated graphics in this one.  The game has less than 50 locations, though time is a factor - the gremlins home in on Billy with every move he makes, so there is no chance to dawdle. The design means that deaths are more frequent than in most adventures. It uses the same parser as the other Adventure International games of this era.

		<name>Miami Vice</name>
		<desc>In this spin-off from a popular TV cop show of the 1980s, Crockett and Tubbs are trying to smash a drugs ring bossed by Mr. J. You have to start at the bottom, initially busting the casual dealers before reaching their suppliers, and ultimately the casino-dwelling honchos. 

This is done through a combination of driving and shooting, through an overhead rendition of Miami. When crooks are stopped they will often provide valuable information, although sometimes they can only be stopped by shooting them. 

When you learn of a meeting, you can enter it on foot, either to gain evidence or make an arrest - but remember that a joint full of crooks will not simply allow you to do your civic duty. This is all done against a time limit, with a one-minute penalty for crashing the car.

		<desc>The first of Blinky the ghost's three outings, the ghost with the most has to progress through a series of levels and remove the hazards left by ghost-busters (who aren't called Peter, Egon, Winston or Ray for licensing reasons). He does this by collecting the right objects to cast the all important spells.

The levels themselves scroll sideways and are layered with platforms. Making the task difficult are spiders, mice and the like - watch out in particular for the jumping frogs. Once the appropriate spells have been cast (involving lots of back-tracking to collect objects and bring them to the cauldron) the objects to make an underwater diving suit must be obtained.

		<name>Blockbusters</name>
		<desc>Bob Holness hosted this fondly-remember quiz show, in which students competed to answer enough questions correctly to complete a run of answers across the board. This was the latest and most sophisticated computer version of the concept.

The exact mechanics of the game have been customized slightly. You start by choosing a question, which are all represented by the first letter of the answer. You must 'buzz in' by pressing your letter to input the answer (don't worry about exact spelling). If you get the question wrong, the computer chooses a square (seemingly with no strategy). In two player games each player has their own buzzer , and a correct answer sees you choose the next question. A digitized version of Bob's face reads out the questions - just be careful if you get any where the answer is 'organism'....

Initially you must make your way through an arrangement of walls, shooting out spiders as you go, before reaching the back door and opening it. Next, you find yourself in a river, avoiding and shooting piranhas (unlike the other two sections, in this one you travel from right-to-left, rather than left-to-right). Finally, you must pass through the Infernal Regions under the seas, ultimately taking on the Dark One, before repeating all of this with increased difficulty. Losing one of your three lives sends you back to the first section of the difficulty block.

		<desc>Aliens using a time machine have changed several crucial events in earth history. As Starion, a rookie starfighter pilot in 2010AD, you must correct these, in a hybrid of puzzle and action.

There are 243 sectors to correct, each representing a year. After selecting one, you are involved in first-person space dogfighting, viewed from within your cockpit. Pay attention to your multi-directional scanner to locate ships and mines. There are also indicators for your fuel and oxygen levels, pitch and yaw, and engine temperature.

Shot enemies release letters, which must then be flown over. Once an area is cleared, you must use the letters to form a word. Then, fly through the time gate, and decide which historical event the word relates to.

		<desc>You have been recruited for Operation Wolf, a desperate attempt to rescue prisoners from the enemy. Through a series of missions, you'll engage a variety of enemies, from soldiers to ninjas, patrol boats to helicopters, and more. Can you carry the day?

Operation Wolf is an arcade conversion of the game by Taito. It is essentially a bitmapped "rail-shooter", where you basically hold the gun and shoot just about everything that moves, while conserving your ammo and grenades. Shoot ammo/grenades and healing items on the screen to "pick them up". Your primary machine gun can kill everything if you hit it enough times, but you can also use the grenade launcher for really deadly targets like helicopters or armored cars. You can collect a machine gun which will allow you to shoot faster for a few seconds. 

You'll be pummelled by a LOT of enemies. Some will be shooting, others will be tossing grenades, knifes, and more. Some are armored and requires more than a few hits, others dodges. You can shoot grenades and knifes out of the air if you aim well enough. There are also civilians running around which can be shot, but it's not beneficial. 

Bosses appear at the end of some levels, and each has a specific weakness you need to exploit.

The first section involves flying along in your Aerocar, shooting as many of the bad guys as possible while avoiding as many as possible. The second involves avoiding contact with cats and monkeys, by jumping on the backs of crocodiles. The final section involves destroying the actual power unit for his Doppelganger in time to save Penfold.

Tasks include escaping past quicksand, casting spells, clearing a ravine and navigating through caves. The commands include standard movement, searching and inventory functions, as well as lots more to work out for yourselves, aided by over 100 illustrations.

		<desc>Panic at Shilmore Castle! For years it is inhabited by ghost Sir Humphrey and his pals Olli and Lisa but it is bought up by Eugine Portcullis III Jnr who wants to break it down and ship it to the States, bit by bit.
Being rather attached to his castle, Sir Humphrey wants to scare Eugene away for good. Unfortunately, Sir Humphrey has lost his ability to make himself invisible. He can only regain his power by mixing special ingredients that Olli must find.

In this flick-screen platform game you control Olli who must find each ingredient and return it one after another to Sir Humphrey within a set time limit.
In each screen there are spooks, snakes and bats as well as dangerous gapes to avoid. Olli cannot really die, but when touched by a baddie he gets set back at the start of a screen costing valuable time.

Collect all eight ingredients and Eugine Portcullis III Jnr. will be scared away for good.

Numerous, multi-colored ghosts also roam the maze trying to stop you. If you eat one of the power pellets in the maze, the ghosts will temporarily turn blue and run from you. Pac-man can earn bonus points by eating the ghosts when they are in this state. The maze is now in 3-D and is larger than screen which will scroll to follow the action. To help get out of tight spots, Pac-Man now has the ability to jump. But be careful, because some of the ghosts have learned this trick as well and you could end up in a mid air collision!

The King of Argos gives him 12 labours that he has to fulfill.

These twelve labours are symbolized by icons that appear occasionally on the screen. You have to collect these labours while fighting off skeletons that carry swords.  The fights take place in ancient Greek temples amongst other places.
If you hit a labour it will put into an urn but a spider tries to steal the labours from you. Kill it with a well placed blow.
If all twelve labours have been collected he must face the the end boss of the game, the mighty Minotaur.

		<desc>In Driller, the Ketars attempted to blow up the moon Mitral, but you stopped them. Now, they have Energy Collection Devices collectively known as EGOs, and hope to stock them up to use towards the Zephyr One device, and direct its energy at the planet Evath, resulting in a catastrophic radiation overload. 

Your mission is to beam onto their base on the moon Tricuspid, and destroy the EGOs. Destroying one will buy you more of your limited time. The problem is, many are connected to at least 2 others, and those can immediately regenerate, so you must tackle them in an order in which those with only 1 connection are attacked first.

You are inside a space suit, propelled by a Jet Pack with limited fuel, and possess lasers and a shield. Shield energy is limited, but can be recharged through pentagons and rods. In a world viewed through the the Freescape 3D system, you roam the verdant planet of trees, buildings and underground tunnels.

Gameplay has more action than Driller. The Freescape world has a third dimension - due to the jetpack you can leave the ground and look down on the view. You can also rotate the angle and make quick U-turns. You must leave the ground to shoot the active part of an ECD, but the jetpack uses energy at a faster rate, so use this feature sparingly. You must avoid Plexors, which weaken your shield, and deflector devices, which can beam you into prison.

		<name>Sir Fred</name>
		<desc>The whistle of the leaves with the wind of the forest is brutally interrupted by the appearance of a solitary figure between the branches of the shrubs. The sharping air of the North threat with tearing the clothes of the great horseman, "Sir Fred".  His rabid preoccupation for the kidnapping of the princess whom he loves does not appear reflected in his imperturbable expression. He only stops for a moment, with a fleeting blowing to fix, like an arrow, his glance on the walls of the castle and to tighten the teeth with desperation. He never faced so many and so big dangers. In each bend, in each stay of the great castle of Beni-Gómez it's awaiting him, threatening, the death. But there is no space for the doubt nor to lie down back. The decision is already taken. The ground runs, it almost flies under the firm and implacable push of his feet... 

Guide Sir Fred, through the different rooms of the castle, until finding his beloved princess. Take into account that she can be prisoner in different stays, and pay attention to the objects you can find on the way; they will help you to avoid the dangers which are distributed through all the adventure.

		<desc>The Wizard of Akyrz is the eighth game in the in the Mysterious Adventures series. The player begins in the royal palace, where the king asks him to save his daughter from an evil wizard. If the player should succeed, his reward will be priceless.

Most instructions are either 90-degree compass moves, or VERB NOUN commands such as GET PAINTING, FIT CHAIN and CLIMB TREE. On the player's journey he will discover treasures, which must be stored in a special room, reached via a spell. 

Around this time, the Mysterious Adventures game engine was redone to allow complete sentences, instead of the 2-word Scott Adams parser that had been used previously.

		<name>Samurai Warrior - The Battles of Usaji Yojimbo</name>
		<desc>With the Roger Rabbit film (and game) successful, and the Jive Bunny phenomenon shaking up charts worldwide, perhaps it was time to redress the balance away from wimpy rabbits. Stan Sakai's comic character set in the 17th century did this, being capable of a range of martial arts moves. In this licensed game he'll need them to save Japan from being taken over by evil.

The game is side-scrolling and has large beat 'em up elements, but also incorporates Karma. Negative actions such as needless violence will be punished with a loss of Karma, while positives ones (such as bribing those who give Karma) are rewarded. When in combat, energy gauges display the condition of both yourself and your rival. Money collected can be spent on food for energy boosts.

		<desc>You're in a castle, where a series of magical phenomena have been taking place: a young girl and a military armor have been victims of an enchantment. Its author, an evil warlock and our main enemy, has adopted the form of an eagle and has also requested help of a legion of ghosts, monsters, demons, werewolves and other kinds of despicable creatures, that will try to avoid that we can reach their master.

Once we get started, our immediate goal will consist in the following: In the first place, as every classic magician, we should go in search of our crystal ball. Once we have it, we are going to be able to see which are the movements of all the relevant personages in the story (the young lady, the armor and the eagle), also, it's going to show us where are the resting two elements required for our adventure: the magic wand (with which we will counter-enchant the girl) and the book of spells (essential to break the spell of the armor). 

Here it is where the graphical innovations of the program will occupy the an important place in the game. All these monitorings above mentioned are possible because the screen is divided in two zones. In the superior part we will see the adventures of our personage. Simultaneously, in the inferior zone, there will appear the exact place of the castle in which the object or personage we are looking for is located.

		<desc>As the name suggests, this arcade conversion updates the basic Asteroids gameplay. That means to say that the main gameplay consists of flying through single-screen wrap-around levels shooting at rocks, which split into smaller rocks when hit, eventually becoming small enough to disappear. 

In this case the Asteroids are protecting Mukor, an evil being who is poisoning planets under the Colonising Corp’s control.
Each level is split into either 9 or 16 sub-levels, which are chosen through a square in which any remaining level which is adjacent to the last level completed can be selected. There are 3 different ships (Speeder, Fighter and Warrior), which can be switched between at any time. Power-ups (including improved weapons, shield recharges and a faster thrust) can be collected by flying into them.

		<desc>The Headmaster of a private school has his wallet stolen one day and blames one of the school boys for it. The school boy, who has the reputation of getting into trouble far too many times, must prove his innocence by exploring the school grounds and the nearby town, collecting items and taking them to the right place. 
Each location that the boy visits have names, with some of them providing a clue on the tasks that must be accomplished there. 

A wide variety of items can be collected, and these include a stereo, a cassette tape, a school tie, and a mortar board. Only two items can be carried at a time, and the boy can jump over certain items if he does not want to collect them. 

The school itself is empty, except for deadly objects that float around the room whenever the boy is present and prevent him from getting the required items. Contact with these objects drain the boy's energy, but this energy can be restored by getting food. Once his energy reaches zero, he loses one of his lives. If all his lives are lost, the boy faces expulsion.

		<desc>Crime is getting out of control in Liberty City, and to combat the problem, the LCPD establishes a new unit, called ESWAT (Enhanced Special Weapons and Tactics). Police officers who are promoted to this unit wear a cyber-suit that contains state-of-the-art military equipment including two Turbo-Booster Thrusters, extra ammunition, and increased protection. In order to become an ESWAT member, all a dedicated police officer has to do is arrest enough criminal masterminds to progress through the ranks, which include Captain, Assistant Chief, and Chief.

ESWAT: Cyber Police is a horizontal-scrolling beat 'em up where you have to make your way from left to right and defeat a mastermind. There are 15 stages to complete, and have you patrolling through Liberty streets, car yards, stadiums, restaurants, the CBD, construction sites, and boat docks. While you're out on patrol, you can pick up ammunition, and the amount you get varies. For example, on some levels, ammo may be worth 10 bullets, while in others, you may get 60 bullets. Once you have obtained the cyber-suit, you wear it for the duration of the game.

		<name>Back to the Future Part III</name>
		<desc>Back to the Future III is a collection of four arcade games. Marty McFly and Doc Brown have traveled back through time to the year 1885 - and they're soon deep in trouble when they face "Mad Dog" Tannen's gang and have to find a way to return to the present. This game takes four scenes from the Hollywood movie Back to the Future III and turns them into arcade sequences:

1. Buckboard Chase: Doc Brown goes horseback in an attempt to save Hill Valley's lovely school teacher Clara. This game of quick ducking, jumping and shooting alternates between a side-scrolling and a top-down perspective.

2. Shooting Gallery: The name says it all. A classic game of aim-and-shoot, spiced up by hidden extras and bonus targets.

3. Pie Throwing: Meet the Mad Dog gang. They have guns, and you have... cream pies. It's an isometric version of the shooting gallery, only with ammo. And the targets shoot back.

4. The Train: Basically a side-scrolling beat-em-up on train wagons with some ducking and jumping. Get rid of the mechanics and collect speed logs to push the engine to a magic 88 mph.

To help out, you have a magic wand which can be used to create and destroy blocks (though some blocks can't be destroyed). In order to reach the key you will need carefully to arrange the blocks on the screen so you can jump your way around safely. Wandering around each level are a variety of enemies which will cause you to lose a life if you're caught. Some creatures can be killed by destroying the block they are standing on, others must be dodged. Hidden bonuses and magic can be found on many of the levels, sometimes even hidden in blocks. Some treasures give you bonus points, others can form magic spells to help deal with the enemies. To make the game more difficult, each level has a time limit in which it must be completed.

		<desc>The Dictator from the first Beach Head game is back, but World War 2 is over. Giving himself a new name, "The Dragon", he seeks revenge against the victorious allied forces. To further these ends, he kidnaps hostages and brings them to his island fortress...

Controlling either the forces of the Allied Commander (J.P. Stryler) or the Dictator (The Dragon), you will have to perform objectives across four different sequences, each with different perspective and controls.

In Sequence 1 "Attack", the allies invade the dictators base with soldiers dropped from a helicopter. The allied forces must land their soldiers and then march them forwards taking cover at different walls. The dictator only has to shoot them down with a machine gun.

In Sequence 2 "Rescue", the hostages are being rescued. The player who controls the allies will use the machine gun to defend hostages as they cross the open courtyard. The dictator can deploy between four different weapons: Man on top of wall, Tank, Truck and Trap Door, only one of which is on the screen at any time.

In Sequence 3 "Escape", hostages are loaded onto the helicopters. The allied player will select how to place hostages on helicopters and then man the controls, avoiding attack. The dictator chooses the level of the automated defense and then aims his tanks at the helicopter. 

In the final sequence, "Battle", the allied commander and the dragon finally encounter one another deep underground. They will toss poontas (throwing knives) at each other until only one is left standing.

If you succeed, you get to continue on, fail and you are out of the race. The driving conditions will vary as the days pass by; not only will you have to drive at different times of day with different amounts of light, but the seasons can change as well. Snow, ice, and fog will occasionally appear to make driving more treacherous. With each day that passes, the other cars will become faster and more aggressive. At the bottom of the screen is an odometer, so when the race is finally over you can see how far you made it.

		<path>./Rescue from Atlantis (Side A) (Europe).tzx</path>
		<name>Rescate Atlantida</name>
		<desc>The advanced civilization of the planet Somerset built a gigantic exploratory spaceship called Atlantis, and sent it to research the planet Earth. After the completion of its task, the ship submerged to an oceanic abyss. The D.A.G. ("giant-looking depredators"), a war-mongering civilization, took possession of Atlantis with the intention of conquering Somerset and the universe. Somerset sends a hero to rescue Atlantis from the enemy, and return it home.

Rescue from Atlantis is a Spanish side-scrolling action-adventure game divided in three loads:

1.  In the first load, the hero must find a way to gain entrance to the camouflage city built on top of Atlantis. This level starts with the bathysphere being dropped from the sky into the ocean by a spaceship. Once it hits the bottom, the player can guide it by using O and P to move left and right, respectively. Q makes it go up, and A cycles through its inventory. The bathysphere is armed with a laser gun that can be fired by pressing the SPACE bar. Hitting M ejects the protagonist from the bathysphere as to explore more strait entrances. Once out, M also serves as the GET, DROP, ENTER and USE button. There are objects scattered on the sea floor to be collected and used. The bathysphere also comes with some useful paraphernalia:

? A laser pistol to kill the enemy and the sea life;
? A jetpack to reach higher places;
? A portable computer to connect with the main one in Atlantis;
? A mould to fabricate gold bars. There are some gold nuggets on the submersed caves (to melt them the player has to find a source of heat);
? A first-aid kit that can only be used once.

The player investigates a complex of aquatic tunnels while collecting the needed tools for the task ahead. At the top of the screen there are two horizontal bars. The leftmost indicates the oxygen level (there are places on the levels that replenish it). The one in the right side is the bathysphere fuel level, once empty the vessel will stop moving. The player must find sources of fuel to make it swim again. Amongst the two bars sits the inventory of both the bathysphere and the character. At the bottom of the screen there are two scores and a plant between them. The plant is the energy level of the character, it changes with every hit he/she/it receives. The left score is the current score, the one on the right is the top score. In this first load, the main danger comes from the creatures of the sea: octopuses, sharks and abyssal fishes take a bit of the energy when the character touches them.

 In the second load the bathysphere enters the city that was raised on Atlantis, now under the sea and in ruins. Guarding the entrance to the ship is Korx, a powerful D.A.G. mage. The main objective of this level is to find a way to destroy him (he is invulnerable to the laser weapons). Besides the animals of the previous load, the character has to fight hammerheads and some alien creatures.

 The final load sees the bathysphere entering Atlantis. The ship is a mechanical labyrinth, with lifts and sentinel robots. The main objective is to find the computer room, where the hero can activate the ship and bring it back to Somerset.

The game has a password system: after solving each load, an alphanumeric code is displayed on the screen. The code is generated based on the actions accomplished. The second and third load require this code to start. It is possible to reach an unwinnable situation by failing to collect or assemble the necessary objects for the completion of a later level.

		<name>Saboteur II - Avenging Angel</name>
		<desc>The ninja hero of the original Saboteur game has been killed, and his sister Nina is out to avenge this injustice. She has an array of kung-fu moves on offer, and must put them to use through 700 screens of action. The game design is very similar to the original, right down to the unusual background graphical style. The sections of the game are on multiple levels, separated mainly by ladders, and with lots of weapons and ammunition to pick up along the way. To beat the game you'll have to collect tapes and collect a 14-part computer code.

The game is a vertically-scrolling shoot 'em up with 5 levels. The first of these involves clearing their defences to reach the alien sector, then you face the jungle, ice and desert planets, before reaching the final alien compound. The game's enemies have a variety of attack patterns and formations, as well as varied and colourful appearance.

		<desc>Toi Acid Game begins while the protagonist, the Toi, is having a date in a discotheque with his girlfriend, Zoi. And then, there appears the usual crazy scientist, in this case called Dr Acid, who kidnaps the hero's girlfriend with the intention to provide diversion to his diabolic creations. The small and roundish friend cannot allow this, so he goes quickly to her rescue.

In order to accomplish it, he will have to face four different levels in which all kind of tiny beasts will try to cut his way. Thus, on the first stage, the disco, he will have to avoid some crude dudes, siphons, drinks which fall from above, etc., whereas he desperately looks for the eight plates that will allow the access to the next levels, which are: the beach, the pirate ship, and finally, the Acid House.

		<desc>Bearded inventor Sir Clive Sinclair was so respected by users of his computer system that he even starred in this game. 

As the title suggests, the game involves navigating Clive past a series of mundane tasks. To give you a clue, the first level involves getting out of bed, getting a suit from a cupboard (dodging a TV, a Spectrum and a cat in doing so), then going upstairs to collect a key (dodging what appears to be an alien), then going back downstairs through the door. Unusually, all points are assessed and awarded after the level is completed.

		<path>./Wacky Darts (Europe).tzx</path>
		<name>Wacky Darts</name>
		<desc>The bar-room game of darts involves aiming small projectiles at a circular board. The board is divided into 20 shapes around the edge, each of which has a value from 1 to 20 points, a special 'double' area around the edge, and a special 'treble' area in the middle (each of which multiply the shot score). There is also a Bullseye right in the middle for 50 points, and an Outer Bull around it, worth 25 points. 

Players always take three shots at a time. In the 501 game the aim is to reduce your score from 501 to 0, finishing with a double or the bull. If your score reaches 1 or a negative number, any shots in that set of 3 are cancelled out. In Round The Board you must hit each target in turn starting with 20, but moving back 2 or 3 for a double or treble, eventually finishing with Double Top.

Both of these games are recreated in this simulation. The movement of the cursor you use to aim is slightly skiddy, to recreate natural jitters (or, as some would cynically suggest, the effects of being as drunk as most darts players).

Wacky Darts lives up to its name by featuring an assortment of human, alien and machine opponents of varying difficulties. Each of them has a short profile, and use a different object to hit the board.

		<name>Bubble Bobble</name>
		<desc>Bubble Bobble is the story of two humans, Bub and Bob who wander into the mysterious cave of monsters and magically turn into dinosaurs. The only way to transform back is to reach the end of the cave...

Bubble Bobble is a platform game, with each level being a single screen. The enemies must be cleared from a level to go to the next one. With one player controlling Bub and the other controlling Bob, the player can jump and collect items for points (such as fruit). The real power Bub and Bob have however is the ability to blow bubbles. These bubbles can be as platforms to leap on, or to trap enemies. Enemies trapped in a bubble must be popped by jumping into them, wherein they'll turn to fruit. Additionally, power-ups sometimes float by in bubbles. They include lightning, which flies out horizontally at enemies, and water, which drags the player and enemies straight down flowing over platforms. Taking too long to complete any level will summon Baron Von Blubba, who will float around the screen trying to destroy the player.

		<desc>The third part of the popular series, Boulder Dash III adds a sci-fi spin to the graphics (called MetalGrafik), with Rockford now wearing a spacesuit and running through a more futuristic setting.

Other than that, the 16 new scenarios are similar in gameplay to the levels of Boulder Dash I and II: Rockford still digs through a series of caves to retrieve diamonds. Once he has enough diamonds, a portal opens that takes him to the next stage. Obstacles in the caves include boulders, monsters which will kill Rockford upon touching them (but which can be eradicated by crushing them with falling boulders - some of the monsters then release a number of diamonds), and green slime that spreads through the entire cave and blocks pathways. Additionally, every level has a time limit. Several puzzle elements add variety to the game, such as walls which will turn falling boulders into diamonds.

		<path>./Kat Trap (Europe).tzx</path>
		<name>Kat Trap</name>
		<desc>In the 24th century, Earth is pounded by solar explosions and abandoned by humans, and the planet is recolonized by a dangerous race known as Kat Men. When the solar explosions died, the humans decide to return to Earth.  When the Kat Men refuse to leave, a war droid known as MT-ED, or Multi Terrain Exploration Droid, is sent down to deal with the Kat Men. Accompanying him is Hercules 1, a maintenance and combat droid. When the two droids are beamed down, things take a turn for the worse. Hercules is kidnapped and  taken far away to the Kat Men's Nerve Center. It is MT-ED's task to get rid of the Kat Men and rescue Hercules. 

To do this, MT-ED has to explore fourteen environments and deal with deadly creatures that are within each environment, with each type of creature requiring a certain type of weapon to be defeated. These weapons - including lasers, water bombs, grenades, and rockets - can be picked up along the way, and MT-ED can switch between them with ease. If MT-ED comes into contact with any of the creatures, he is kicked into the air and gets stunned for a few seconds. If this happens, he loses one of his lives. Not all creatures are deadly; some of them will steal whatever weapons MT-ED is carrying at the time.

Besides using weapons to kill, MT-ED also has the ability to jump over creatures that may be too slow for him to shoot. When MT-ED finally rescues Hercules, a sub-game needs to be completed. When MT-ED completed this sub-game, the Kat Men's Central Computer is disabled and the Kat Men go back where they came from.

A long hallway with seven doorways in it at the start offers the player the opportunity to enter dungeon areas of varying difficulty (easiest and more open at the top, hardest at the bottom). In these areas of the tower, the player can explore, finding treasure and elixir bottles (which can be used to replenish the player's magic). Of course, things aren't that simple. The Things roam the various corridors and will chase and attack the player on sight, even going so far as to disguise themselves as ordinary objects until the player comes in range. Fortunately, the player has sword and bow, as well as magical spells, to defend and heal himself. Will this be enough for you to raise a fortune in loot or will The Things see you to your doom?

Colin is on his trusty bike, which must avoid oil slicks, other traffic and contact with walls, but can pick up Skips for an energy boost. Many of the buildings you can enter have nothing of interest, but many have upgrades for the bike. The most important of these are the headlamps you need so as to see into the darkest area of the game world.

The loadout and starting positions are predefined, but you can change the loadout, choosing from two types of ammo, three types of rockets, explosives, first aid kits, transporters, and armor.

The game plays like a strategic third person shooter. You control the commander of the current squad, and can switch between the three. Also, there are computer terminals scattered around that can turn off some of the automated defenses and cameras.

Some parts of the track are blocked unless you can shoot through obstacles before reaching them, or hit a jump pad. At some points you can change to travelling along the ceiling as well. Tokens can be collected en route, and used to obtain better weapons, but losing a life costs you the best one you’ve currently got.

The game features over 300 screens worth of gameplay, split into 26 sections which are identified by the letters of the alphabet. These markers also act as restart points for when you lose one of your 3 lives. The aliens drop bombs at you, which must be dodged.

		<name>Street Cred Football</name>
		<desc>Removing the corporate poshness and ambition of modern football, this Players title gives you a basic street match for one or two human players. Hitting the crate which is used to represent a goal more times than the opponent to win is the only rule. Your team of 5 players is selected from a pool of 24, including representations of the programmers as well as Joe Blade and other Players characters, and these can be placed at will around the pitch. Once in play you control the player nearest the ball, with full passing and shooting control available. Dirty challenges are not only permitted but encouraged.

		<name>Tapper</name>
		<desc>Tapper is an action game where you're a beer tapper (barman) and have to serve beer to demanding customers. There are four customers, each has its own lane lengthier than the previous one, whom you have to keep at bay. If they reach the end of the lane without receiving their beer, you're a goner; if you miss one and accidentally spill beer needlessly you lose a life and should one of them throw you back the mug and you fail to catch it, you lose a life as well.

Occasionally a bizarre icon will appear on one of the lines and, should you grab it, will invoke a &amp;quot;cabarette&amp;quot;-style show which will keep some of the customers occupied.

The Xbox 360 version includes bonus rounds, as well as co-op and versus multiplayer modes, also online, along with achievements.

		<name>Hunchback - The Adventure</name>
		<desc>As they went on to demonstrate with Nightbreed, Ocean wasn't afraid to try a few different approaches to licensed material once they'd gotten their mitts on it, which is how you explain following up not one but two run-and-jump platform games with a text adventure game -- the change in approach a breath of fresh air and, perhaps, a response to critics suggesting that rehashing the same old thing is getting tired and stale.

Many arcade games of the period would have a hard time with the transition, lacking enough of a skeleton of plot to flesh out with characters and events, but the Hunchback franchise has always enjoyed descent from one of the greatest works of French fiction (not incidentally long since in the public domain, hence ripe for free squeezing), Victor Hugo's Notre-Dame de Paris... even if it hadn't made terribly extensive use of its heritage up to this title.

You are still Quasimodo, deformed ward of the Church, and you still quest for the favour and well-being of gypsy Esperalda, but for once you don't do so by jumping over pits and ducking under arrows (and, uh, participating in organised sporting events)!  Instead, you navigate sites in, around and under Paris, including the Cathedral of Notre Dame, collecting inventory items to use to solve puzzles and overcome minions of the Bishop and Cardinal -- foes who no longer cause you to lose a life at the merest contact.

The narrative does sustain a bit of garbling along the way in the transition from high literature to action arcade game and back to crypto-literary interactive fiction, but they take what they've learned about design along the way and present things clearly, possessions and companions continually visually indicated above a baroque text input/output field.  The interface is as intuitive as those of the prior games in the franchise, despite the enormous gulf between their respective styles of gameplay.  Now you can give your twitchy fingers a rest and let your brain take over for a while.

		<path>./Bumpy (Europe).tzx</path>
		<name>Bumpy</name>
		<desc>The first game in the Bumpy series is, just like its sequels, about a head that can bump a lot. You control whether the head shall bump left or right, and how far up it will bounce, across a series of bouncy platforms. Once you have picked up all items on the screen, the exit appears so that you can go on to the next screen. 

While most platforms are perfectly harmless, some have additional qualities, such as being destructible, thereby granting access to other parts of the screen. Some platforms are on fire, which will turn out lethal unless you have picked up a water droplet in advance. 

Bumpy was remade for 16-bit platforms as Pop-Up, and then ported back once more to the Amstrad CPC.

		<desc>Galaxian is a shoot 'em up in which the player is at the bottom of the screen, with an arrangement of aliens at the top. The player moves left and right to aim at an alien, then shoots a bullet up the screen, and the alien it hits is killed. The aliens are classed as Drones, Emissaries, Hornets and Commanders, with those higher up the screen scoring more points when destroyed. At set intervals an enemy will move down the screen towards you, escorting a bomber, which is a moment of high danger. Clear a wave and another is generated.

The cops think you are somehow involved in the kidnapping, and so your job is obvious: rescue your family members and wash your name clear.

The gameplay could be compared with the Last Ninja series. It has an isometric view and  no scrolling. You can pick up useful items like weapons, which blink when you enter a screen containing such an item.

		<desc>The home conversions of Continental Circus lack the full-on 3D and special glasses of the arcade version, but retain the essential gameplay structure. The first race is in Brazil and features 100 cars, and requires you to finish in the top 80 in order to qualify for  next race. As you work through the 8 races the size of the field steadily decreases, but so does the worst acceptable finishing position to qualify.

The car has high and low gears, and is susceptible to damage from contact with another car. Once you hit a car or a piece of the trackside scenery you will be called into the pits - fail to make it back, or hit another car, and you will crash and lose several seconds.

		<desc>The Way of the Exploding Fist is a martial arts doctrine ensuring that you possess a range of powerful punches, uppercuts, roundhouse kicks and flying kicks. As an evil warlord has enslaved your people, courtesy of his many henchmen and mercenaries, you will need them as you journey to his mountainous hideout to destroy him.

The game is no longer a single screen sequence of Yie Ar Kung Fu style duels, but is more influenced by Renegade, although with strict martial arts moves. However, a combat practice program is also provided, which plays much more similarly to the original game. The action takes place on different levels, which are reached by traversing ladders. There are many doorways to walk through, which cause a switch in the usually-scrolling display.

		<desc>Pac-Land is a side-scrolling 1-2 player game with a cartoony feel to it. Now equipped with arms, face, and legs, Pac must guide a fairy back to her home in Fairy Land, but this task will not be easy because Inky, Blinky, Pinky, Clyde, and Sue will pursue Pac-Man as he travels through Pac-Land. When he finally transports the fairy back to her home, Pac is given some magic shoes, which will help him get to his own home, where he will be greeted by his family: Ms. Pac-Man, Baby Pac-Man, Chomp Chomp, and Sourpuss. 

There are sixteen rounds to complete, with four trips each. During each round, he can grab a power pellet, which cause ghosts to turn blue, allowing Pac-Man to eat them for points. Points are also awarded by collecting fruit that appear, like cherries and strawberries. In some rounds, Pac must use a springboard to jump over a lake. He must also make it to the end of each round before time runs out, otherwise a ghost will chase him.

		<name>Lone Wolf - The Mirror of Death</name>
		<desc>In this out-of-canon adventure of gamebook hero Kai Master Lone Wolf, the player controls the dashing adventurer scaling the interior of warlock Gorazh's sinister magic tower Kazan-Gor -- an inverted pyramid, broadening as it gets higher -- in pursuit of a Lorestone of Nyxator located at the very top.  Imprisoned in his flick-screen tower, Gorazh has filled it with monsters and traps, the most insidious of which was a magic mirror, Dhazag-Oud, whose seven shards reflect back superior counterparts of whoever gazes upon them (and which subsequently result in boss battles.)

The gameplay largely skips over the choose-your-own-adventure sequences of Lone Wolf's gamebook roots and instead just initially prompts the player to select four of eight Kai skills (eg. Mindshield, Sixth Sense, Healing) to use (with restrictions) over the course of his tower travails.  From there, the player controls Lone Wolf's movements, skill use and attack strategies using the keyboard controls.

All this has to be done around all the rigors of a typical school day. you must go to class when the bell goes, or else it's detention, and the other kids will often play around to block you. The game's Artificial Intelligence means that events continue to unfold around you in the other rooms and corridors.

Descend through the alien cave systems to the enemy fortress destroying alien guards and rescuing the captive humans. On your way you will encounter many indigenous hazards, which must be avoided at all costs. Your craft is protected from minor collisions by an invisible energy shield, this will not, however, protect you from more serious collisions with enemy plasma bombs etc., so... exorcise extreme caution!!!!!(sic).

On each of the lower levels is an enemt fuel dump. You can steal fuel and energy from these by simply flying up to the nozzle. When you have rescued all eight men from each level the energy gate will disappear enabling you to descend to the next target. Should you delay too long on any level the alien command saucer will lock on to your position and attempt to ram you.</desc>

Gameplay combines action and puzzle-solving, across four primary towers with three levels each. Doors must be opened using one of the ten included keys. These are unmarked, as are the various potions - making it a challenge to know which keys open which doors, and which potions are beneficial. 

Contact with ghouls drains your energy, as does falling too far (there are narrow pathways to negotiate), while eating cheese can replenish this. Movement and aiming are controlled separately.

		<name>Impossaball</name>
		<desc>Impossaball puts you in control of a ball, and sets you in a checkered 3D environment with walls and ceilings. The ball bounces on the spot as standard, but can be directed to move, or bounce higher to gain momentum. Your task is to land on every cylinder in the level, so as to squash them down to ground level. Lots of spikes protrude in the levels, which must be avoided. Magic rings are both friend and foe - the first contact increases your remaining time, but a further contact loses a life. Other obstacles cause the ball to rebound, which could be good or bad depending on the situation.

		<desc>Wizard Warz is an overhead view action RPG using "classic" graphics. You start of the game as an apprentice wizard with four minor spells, and aim to defeat 7 master wizards to become the chief wizard yourself. To aid you in your quest you must return six treasures to their rightful owners and find more powerful spells. 

There are also numerous monsters to fight on your travels, each with their own strengths and weaknesses to your offensive magical barrage.

You can also use a familiar to help your mission - for example, having a crow will let you see the furthest distance.

		<desc>In the sequel to The Way of the Tiger, Yaemon the Grand Master of Flame is the villain of the piece. He has killed your foster-father Naijish and stolen the Scrolls of Kettsuin.

Your quest to recover the scroll and avenge your father's death is viewed from above and superficially resembles Gauntlet. You start outside the  Quench Heart Keep, and must initially find enough keys in the grounds and connected buildings to penetrate it, and then kill each of the 3 guards.

There are other prey including spiders to fend off - these know how to home in on you. You are armed with a limited number of Shuikch to shoot from distance; after these are gone you are reliant on your bare hand, although more can be collected. Pressing the 1 key summons an energy recharge from the God Kwon, but only a limited number of times.

You have 3 levels of kick and 2 levels of punch available to you, each activated by pressing fire with the joystick pushed in the appropriate direction. Making contact will score you points and weaken your opponent's energy bar. Both fighters are shirtless, and can be hard to distinguish in the heat of the action.

		<name>Heavy Metal</name>
		<desc>This multi-genre military action game puts player in the seat of tactical commander of mechanized forces. Starting as Cadet, you'll raise your career from the rookie, when you should perform actions by yourself in different vehicles, to the ultimate elite, when you should act as a Tactical genius. 

There are three kinds of combat simulations:
1. MBT (main battle tank M1A1 Abrams), where in first-person view you should sit in tank's cockpit, command your gunner and driver, and eliminate surrounding enemies;

2. FAV (fast attack vehicle XR311), where in third-person view you should drive your vehicle in desert, shoot scattered obstacles and enemy helicopters, and avoid the bombs dropped from the skies ;

3. ADAT (air defense anti-tank M1132A), where in first-person view you should shoot air and ground enemies, surrounding your statical position.
Performing useful actions in each mode, you'll gain points, and gathering 5,000 points in each mode will give you a seat of Tactical Commander. Here you'll be able to continue your actions on the field, or perform some tactical moves using the map, which is very similar to the territory, including and surrounding Western Germany.

		<path>./Ah Diddums (Europe).tzx</path>
		<name>Ah Diddums</name>
		<desc>Ah Diddums is a single player game with 99 levels in which the player builds ladders to progress to the next level

Teddy isn't in a normal toy-box, he's in the central toy-box of a nested set of 99 boxes, and to get out he must build a set of steps by piling building bricks in a specific order. In his box Teddy hears baby crying and its his job to take toys to the baby to stop her crying. However, if baby stops crying then the mother will turn out the light. The other toys in the toy-box with Ted can only play when the light is on so they try to stop Teddy comforting the baby. Contact with any of these toys will shred Ted and cost a life.

There are weapons available and these will kill the other toys, however killing all the other toys on a level / in a box brings in the invincible lump of plasticine to hamper Ted
Ted's only friend in all this is a jack-in-a-box, Jack jumps out of his box when when Ted touches it and this frightens all the other toys into being still for a short period.
The game screen is a top down view of the toy-box. Scattered around are bricks and other items some of which, like the pea-shooter, are weapons. Other toys patrol the game area and contact with any of these is lethal.

The game is keyboard controlled with an odd arrangement of keys.

1. To move Ted left or right the keys on the CAPS SHIFT to SPACE row are used in alternating order, i.e. CAPS SHIFT, X, V, N move Ted left, Z, C, B, M moves right.
2. To move TED up the screen, or to pick up objects, alternating keys on the Q to P row are used, so keys Q, E, T, U, O will move Ted, while keys W,R, Y, I, &amp; P will make Ted pick up an object.
3. To move Ted down the screen or to fire a weapon the keys on the A to ENTER row are used, A, D, G, J &amp; L moving Ted while the remainder fire the weapon. 
4. the keys 1 to 0 can be used to pause the game at any time

		<name>Codename Mat II</name>
		<desc>In this sequel to Codename: MAT (the original never appeared on the Commodore 64) you once again take the role of Mat, now the pilot of the Centurion II as he battles the Myons once more.

In the Terranya war it has been discovered that the planet Vesta is full of the most precious substance in the galaxy, Karillium, which with one drop can turn a desert into a jungle. The planet orbits around the star Calest deep in a Myon zone, but the Earth managed to invade and capture the planet with unmanned ships. With the planet full of Karillium mines powered by an energy grid which in turn is powered by Calest, the Myons have decided to destroy the energy grid which will shut down the mines and the miners will leave the planet. Under the rules of war, only one manned ship can defend a inhabited planet and Mat has been lucky enough to be chosen.

The game is viewed from a 1st person perspective as you look out from your cockpit into deep space, with your gun in front of you. Using a Quadrant chart, you can see rows of satellites that power the mines which also shows your locations as well any Myon ships. You are able to control your speed as well as direction and if you need to move larger distances then you can warp as long as you input your direction. As you progress through the game you will find the Myons damaging the satellites and these need repairing by two droids on your ship who can also repair your ship.

Your ship also contains various scanners as well as a manual or automatic targeting system. Once you come across a wave of Myon ships you must destroy them with either your laser or plasma while using the scanners for they position. Once a wave is destroyed then you can repair any damaged satellites or your ship if needed. To help protect yourself from attack your ship has shields with decrease when hits are taken. You cannot be destroyed though because when you are close to destruction you teleport away from the planet. The game is over if the power to the planet is stopped by a damaged row of satellites.</desc>

There are 9 tracks at each of the 4 difficulty levels, which can be raced in any order (although the last track you race is made harder than usual). In the races you win money, which can be spent on the usual handling and power upgrades, as well as forward-shooting missiles. You must finish in the top 3 of each race to progress - initially there are 4 computer opponents, but more are added as you progress through the game

You can upgrade your car throughout the game via the shop section. You are given an initial price, but also a number of options of things to say to the salesman – get the right combination and the price will drop.

Solutions have a sense of realism - you have to dive to avoid bullets and use a mine detector. Objects include an Identicard, a Jetcycle and dipswitches.

		<name>NARC</name>
		<desc>Narc is a 1-2 player game, where your mission is to infiltrate the Mr. Big Corporation, the scourge of the underworld. To do this, you must get through the game's eight stages, with over ten sectors like the junkyard, subway, drug lab, nursery, downtown, Sunset Strip, and even the corporation, where Mr. Big resides. In order to get through the stages, you are required to collect a number of safe cards, and insert them in the slot next to the stage exit.  Each sector includes a map, and should be easy to read. For example, the blue or red dots represent you, and the white dots are the missile launchers, while the "E" indicates the exit.

Your mission ain't going to be easy, as you will come face-to-face with enemies including the canine mutts, Das Lof Gang, Dr. Spike Rush, Joe Rockhead, Kinky Pinky, Sgt. Skyhigh, HQ Posse, and Mr. Big himself. You have two ways you can deal with them: either put a bullet in them or make arrests. Furthermore, they will try to blow you up the minute they see you. Fortunately, you're armed with a shotgun and missile launcher, but these both have a limited supply of ammunition. If your bullet counter reaches one, you can only fire one bullet at a time, so you need to find some more. Also, it is important not to waste all of your missiles: you might need them later when you deal with later enemies like Mr. Big. You are also backed up by a chopper and a mean shiny street machine.

More often than not, when you blow up enemies, you can pick up several items that they drop, including drugs, money, ammunition, missile launchers, and if you're lucky, safe cards.  Even if you got the safe card and can pass the level, you can keep blowing up enemies to score more points. According to the game, this game is for training purposes only, so you will not get employed by your local DEA office. Is this what the DEA does every day: go on rampages?

		<name>Doomdark's Revenge</name>
		<desc>The follow-up to the original Lords of Midnight game uses a similar game system to its predecessor, but the story is now much more complex. Luxor the Moonprince's son Morkin has been kidnapped by Shareth, daughter of Doomdark, the evil ruler deposed in the first game. The player initially takes control of Luxor, Rothron the Wise, and Morkin's lover Tarithel the Fey, although many more characters can be recruited as the game progresses, as they aim to banish Shareth and rescue Morkin. Shareth has brainwashed him, so he must also be turned back to Luxor's side.

The game is effectively turn-based; your characters move by day (with a limited amount of movement possible, with each move in one of the 8 compass directions) and Shareth's by night. You will find plains, mountains, forests, underground tunnels and mysterious temples on your journey. A dark mist follows much of the area, which causes your characters to deteriorate in mood and thus become less effective.

The characters are now split into five distinct tribes - Giant, Dwarf, Fey, Icemark and Barbarians, and recruiting new characters into your party isn't automatic - factors such as the game situation can make some refuse to join, turn on members of other races, or defect (as the Utarg did in the first game).

There are several different objectives and possible outcomes to the game. Bringing Morkin back to the Gates of Varenorn is the most basic one, but many other characters ought to be saved, Shareth can be killed completely (with practice!), and there are many Crowns of Icemark to be retrieved. As in the first game, control of the full party only remains while Luxor is alive - his death means total defeat.</desc>

		<desc>You are Fred, an intrepid archaeologist, interested in visiting the pyramid of Tootiecarmoon looking for a new experience, and in search of treasures and great adventures.

The game consists of 6 levels, on which you must obtain treasures  and - of course - a map that allows you to leave the labyrinthine pyramid alive.

You must avoid dangerous acid drops, mummies, spiders, vampires, etc. In order to defend yourself from those disagreeable enemies you have at your disposition a gun (with limited bullets), but some enemies are immune to guns, and you must jump or avoid them.

		<desc>Zub is a cartoon platform game, the first title developed by the brothers Ste Pickford and John Pickford as a team. In a humorous twist, every creature in the game is named Zub, including the main character. The player controls Zub, an alien warrior that received a mission from his Emperor Zub of the Zub galactic empire: to retrieve the Green Eye of Zub, a powerful artifact.

Zub must ride the intergalactic elevators to reach other planets and continue the search for the Eye. The worlds are very empty, featuring a few platforms and sparsely populated by dangerous monsters called Zubs. Zub must hop to the existing platforms, position them next to each other, and keep jumping and alternating between them to ascend to the top of the level and move to the next planet. The Zubs float around the scene following the hero, trying to touch and drain some of the health energy, and have to be killed with the laser gun.

		<desc>You are leading a mission to destroy Dr. Destructo's array of ships, and ultimately his island hideout, over 21 levels. You do this by flying a plane over a limited area, and shooting his planes so that they fall and inflict damage on the target item, which is large at the bottom of the screen. Multiple shots on a particular spot will ultimately cause a water-spout; three waterspouts and the ship (or island) will sink. 

Some enemy beings can be shot down, but others are indestructible and require evasive action. You are also armed with a bomb, which can be used to inflict precise damage once per level. One of the features of this game is that it uses a day/night cycle.

		<path>./Gyroscope (Europe).tzx</path>
		<name>Gyroscope</name>
		<desc>Releasing a game which resembles a well-known arcade game before any official license can be released was always a challenge for publishers, and in this case Melbourne House released a game similar to Marble Madness. Controlling a gyroscope, you most navigate your way down a sloping track full of hazards. The viewpoint is in fixed isometric 3D, with hazards including buildings, ramps and drops. The gyroscope accelerates quickly and takes time to slow down, so it is easy to go into a screen too fast.

Failing to keep the gyroscope spinning freely as it navigates these costs you one of your seven lives. You are also playing within a time limit - losing a life sees you return to the start of a level without regaining lost time, but running out of time sees you lose a life, but be able to continue from where you were left with a new set of time (so, as with Chase HQ, completing tricky levels can take 2 or 3 lives at first). 

You get time bonuses for completing a screen, points bonuses for completing one of the seven four-screen levels, and an extra life for reaching 1000 points.
At the end of level 7, you will get 1000 points for each remaining lives, doubling your current amount of lives. You will then start again at level 1 but mirrored by the vertical axis (you are now climbing from the bottom of screen to the top).
After level 14 (level 7 mirror), you will again win 1000 points for each remaining lives and then the game loop on level 1 (not mirrored).

Armed only with a sword and 'star knives', you must fight your way through countless henchmen and the occasional boss to complete your task.  Levels include the forest, moat, inside and outside of the castle.  These levels repeat as the seasons change.  The gameplay is side scrolling.  Kage's moves include the ability jump extremely high in the air, grab and climb trees, block and attack with his sword, and throw shuriken.  The game can be challenging at times though because the player dies in one hit.  2-players are supported, but must take turns.

Prostitute Vera Cruz sprawled on the floor in her "Forest" apartment was found by caretaker. The pool of blood poured from a bullet wound in her chest. It was believed to be a case of suicide with a gun as the weapon involved. But you have to prove that it was a murder.

The gameplay flows in two parts: crime scene investigation to collect the evidence, and work with telex machine to gain information about possible suspects.

At the crime scene, you should collect all possible evidence moving the marker on the screen and examining the objects scattered at the scene as well as the body itself.

With telex machine you should perform investigation according to the police procedures. Different actions are possible here such as sending messages within Diamond Network to receive the replies, printing the notes, contacting other Police services to gain the new information, comparing the evidences, carrying out examinations such as autopsy, interviewing/checking the alibis of suspects, and arresting finally. To specify the subject for each action you should type it.

Gameplay consists of moving your character in real-time through various terrains, like forests, towns, and dungeons. The player gathers basic items, like health and magic potions, and increasingly powerful weapons as you progress through the story. Conversations are handled through keyphrases. Combat is real-time as well, against a few types of creatures (skeletons, orcs, rogues) of which there can be various flavors.

		<path>./Combat School (Europe).tzx</path>
		<name>Combat School &amp; Gryzor Preview</name>
		<desc>The control panel consists of a trackball and two buttons with different functions depending on the event. The game can be played against a CPU-controlled opponent or a second player. Player 1 takes control of Nick, a brown-haired recruit in an orange shirt, while Player 2 is Joe, a blond-haired recruit in a blue shirt. The game system is similar to Konami's Track &amp; Field series.

The game is composed of seven training events whom the player must complete. Upon a near-success failure to complete an event (failing too severely results in game over), the player must do a set number of chin ups as punishment (this chance is given only once) in order to continue into the succeeding events, or it's game over. The events are as followed:

    Obstacle Course ? Set in a side-scrolling segment, the player must reach the end of the stage under the allotted time before his opponent while climbing walls and clearing bars. Losing to the CPU or to one another does not mean Game Over as long as the players cross the finish line within the allotted time.
    Shooting Range No. 1 ? The player must shoot as many targets as possible under the allotted time. If played against a second player, then the one who shoots the most targets win.
    Iron Man Race ? Similar to the obstacle course, but set in a top view angle. The player must reach the goal while avoiding mines and other obstacles. Eventually the player must cross a lake by either swimming or rowing a boat. Losing to the CPU or to one another does not mean Game Over as long as the players cross the finish line within the allotted time.
    Shooting Range No. 2 ? Same as the first one, but now with moving targets.
    Arm Wrestling ? The two recruits are pitted against each other in a match of strength and stamina. This is more like a bonus stage than an actual course: the player is not penalized for losing.
    Shooting Range No. 3 ? The third and final shooting range stage features penalty targets.
    Fighting ? The player faces against his instructor in hand-to-hand combat in the final event. There is no make-up punishment in this event. If a player loses this event, it is game over no matter what. If played with a second player, then the two players must fight each other. Only the victor is allowed to graduate.

After all seven events are cleared, the player graduates from basic training only to be sent on a mission (the 8th and the final stage) to rescue the U.S. President from armed terrorists. The final stage consist of a single side-scrolling level where the player must fight off terrorists using all the skills acquired during the course of training. This stage can only be played by one player. Without a continue feature, without spare stocks of lives, and the player dies with one hit (minus the part that pits you in a hand-to-hand combat against the terrorist leader) from anything, the final stage is extremely difficult to clear.</desc>

At the start, the game will randomly generate his Skill, Stamina and Luck - you can regenerate these if you don't like the initial values. As you play your experience statistic will increase.

The graphics are created in memory before being copied onto the screen; this causes some pixellated areas, but there's a full examine option with some helpful hints as to the item's benefit/risk.

The lair is on many levels, and most rooms have multiple exits across the 8 compass directions. Vampires and Werewolves are among the many creatures which guard the corridors - you use magic to kill or freeze these, although some can be beaten back by possessing certain objects.

Reaching the end of each level sees bonuses for time and kills. The path through the game can be varied on later levels, so you can play it through more than once and find new sections, even though the individual levels only scroll left-to-right.

There are 13 stages to complete by jetting around and blasting bad guys and bosses as they approach. The game is played from behind the main character and the landscape rushes up in 3D similar to the effect used in many car games such as Outrun.

The game uses many of the enemies and bosses from the first Space Harrier, but adds an array of new ones as well.

Once inside you must control your space droid so as to disable all the core spots. There are many patrol drones inside each mine - avoid these at all costs. There are five mines in total, the first four of which can be attempted in any order.

		<name>Endurance</name>
		<desc>Endurance uses the same basic game system as CRL's Formula One, but turns its attention to motorcycle racing. As the title suggests, the six races featured are all lengthy, and include two 24-hour races for your two bikes (each with 2 riders assigned to it) to complete. Before each race you must set the bike up, trading off speed, fuel consumption and safety for the engine, and speed, safety and tyre wear for the chassis; you must also choose one of the 3 tire compounds. Options are selected using a menu-based system, mostly by clicking on words.

Races are depicted via a side-view of the bikes scrolling past the pit straight, with constant updates as to the race leader and any bike problems. You can instruct your riders as to how aggressively to race, and  must call your bikes in for pitstops to refuel, change tyres and swap riders. As in the previous game these are controlled in real-time by moving the mechanic around.

There are other cars on the road, which you must avoid contact with. Bumps and divots in the road throws the car off course, as does contact with any of the roadside barriers.

		<desc>Strange happenings are afoot once again in Sweethaven and only Popeye can make it right. In Popeye 2, our spinach lovin' hero must once again rescue Olive Oyl and make mincemeat of Bluto while looking after Swee'Pea, feeding Wimpy and keeping an eye on Jeep.

Popeye has four different levels to traverse through. His initial adventure takes him to a construction site where bouncing springs, falling girders and open welding flames impede his progress. Rolling barrels, and bombs which must be touched to be put out also stand to cause harm. In every level scattered hamburgers must be collected in order for Popeye to get past Wimpy who is often hanging out somewhere near the top of every vertically scrolling platform level. There are also feats of strength that Popeye must perform by beating up a punching robot-type thing with the aid of Spinach. Once past all these obstacles Popeye can move on to the next level.

The second level takes Popeye into the urban jungle where he must climb the side of the Biff Spinach building and avoid the same obstacles as in the previous levels. In the third level falling girders are replaced with giant bananas as Popeye finds himself in a jungle. Coconut throwing monkeys hang from ledges and snoozing tigers and snakes decorate the trees. The fourth and final level of the game finds Popeye climbing the masts of the S.S. Trev and the S.S. Andy as he makes his way to a final confrontation with Bluto and rescue Olive Oyl.

Popeye is able to jump around and occasionally when the situation calls for it punch his way through this vertical platformer. Bonus points are rewarded for finding Swee'Pea and Jeep. He can take multiple hits before he takes a curtain call but thankfully is unharmed by long drops. The player should beware as Popeye has only one life to get through the four levels of this adventure.

Your character has limited ammo, and can replenish this by walking over dead soldiers. You must also watch your thirst level, and head into the hotel at the top of the screen before it reaches zero. As well as the bandits, their horse regularly crosses the screen and must be avoided.

As a bonus, the Spectrum version includes a free game called A-Maze, which is unsurprisingly maze-based.

You, in a space suit and with a laser gun, have to regain control of a factory located in Outer Space. The factory, where robots are produced, has been taken over by aliens and they are reprogramming the robots to take over planet Earth.
To take over control of the factory you have to reach the central Control Room but to get there you have to overcome many obstacles and collect several objects.
These objects can be used to perform several tasks of which some must be done before you take over the computer by stopping it.
Fuel and patches for your suit can be picked up and retrieve items such as rings and spanners, which are given out by robots or just left around on the floor.

Strange Loop has an option to save and load the current game status.

		<desc>Cruising is one of the simplest computer games possible, and one which probably has been independently invented more than one time. The concept is similar to games such as Cuthbert Goes Walkabout, in that your goal is to colour all lines on the screen while avoiding the nasties that might get in your way.

Unlike the aforementioned game, though, Cruising doesn't simply divide the screen into a grid. Instead, the lines make more intricate patterns, more so for each "grid" that you clear. Another feature is that you can make a cut in the grid so that the "chaser" can't follow you that way. Just make sure not to cut off your own escape route!

Jim must get on to a ship and avoid the enemies before being whisked off to Treasure Island. On the island Jim must encounter and avoid various pirates. Scattered on the island are cutlasses which can be used to kill pirates blocking his path. Beware though, cutlasses are limited so Jim doesn't want to waste them on any old pirate. Get hit by a cutlass or touched by a pirate and you lose a live sending you back to the start of the screen.

Search the island, find Long John Silver and become rich beyond your wildest dreams.

The game is viewed from a side, top down view. The game doesn't scroll but flicks to the next screen as you explore this maze. Your score is shown as a percentage of the game completed.</desc>

		<name>Nineteen Boot Camp</name>
		<desc>As one of up to four newly recruited soldiers at the time of the Vietnam War (these people had an average age of 19, as the title refers to), you must first face the tough Boot Camp. Conceptually it’s similar to Boot Camp, a fact which can’t be disguised even by the Konami game being known as ‘Combat School’ in Europe. Show enough stamina, skill and determination in these four events and you have proved yourself worthy to fight for the US.

First you must complete a horizontally-scrolling assault course, with jumps to make my holding down fire to get a yellow bar at the bottom of the screen (hold the button for too long or not long enough and you get a red bar and have to abort the jump, thus wasting time), and monkey bars to waggle your way through. Next up is a shooting range, in which you look through a sightscreen to target the enemies (and avoid the innocent civilians) as they appear on the large screen in front of you. Driving through an assault course is your third task, with damage-inducing hazards to drive around and stars to collect for bonus points. Finally you must do some hand-to-hand combat, before getting your final scores.

Most instructions are either 90-degree compass moves, or VERB NOUN commands such as GET PAINTING, FIT CHAIN and CLIMB TREE. On the player's journey he will discover treasures, which must be stored in a special room, reached via a spell. 

Around this time, the Mysterious Adventures game engine was redone to allow complete sentences, instead of the 2-word Scott Adams parser that had been used previously.

Together, they manage a small martial arts training school, teaching their students in self-defense. One day, Billy's girlfriend, Marian, is kidnapped off the street by the "Black Warriors", a savage street gang led by a man named Willy. The Black Warriors demand the Lee brothers disclose their martial arts secrets in exchange for Marian's freedom. The Lee brothers set out on a rescue mission to crush the Black Warriors and save Marian.

Using whatever techniques they have at their disposal, from the basic punches and kicks to the invulnerable elbow strike, as well any weapon that comes into their hands, the Lee brothers must pursue the gang through the city slum, industrial area and the forest before reaching their hideout to confront the big boss, Willy.

Nothing unusual there, but the tanks and mounted turrets of Panzadrome are robotic, and controlled by a central computer. Plasma vents send their power throughout the network, and are destructible but heavily protected by tanks – these are thus your main target.

Upgrades to your tank can be purchased from robot factories, each of which offers a single product. The most important of these is the Polycrete, which allows you to repair the huge impassable craters that are left in the ground by enemy fire. This adds a puzzle element to the game, as you aim to kill tanks in wide areas where possible, to prevent boxing yourself in. Keep an eye on the scanner in order to avoid landmines, and don’t allow your shields to be destroyed.

		<desc>With Agent X having been a success in both critical and commercial terms, a sequel was inevitable. The Mad Professor's cunning plan this time is to infect everybody with acne, thus causing the economy to crumble (and not just the economy for Valentine's cards). As with the original, the game is split into distinct sections - as with the original these are each loaded one at a time.

The first section is a horizontally-scrolling shoot 'em up, where Agent X flies freely and must collect powerful weapons to be able to get through. This is followed by some platform action, which involves climbing a tower collecting code pieces along the way. The final section is a Breakout clone, pre-dating Arkanoid as the first game to give a plot behind basic brick-bashing, with the twist that a moving bat at the top of the screen fires the ball back towards you unpredictably.

		<name>The New Zealand Story</name>
		<desc>One day, a kiwi tribe was having fun and games outside the zoo, only to be kidnapped by the evil-minded Leopard Seal, who plans to sell them at the black market. Fortunately, during the kidnapping process, Tiki, leader of the tribe, managed to escape the sack, and her job is to rescue Phee-Phee and the other kiwis scattered around New Zealand, and are held in cages in various locations that include Auckland, Rotorua, Waitomo Caves, Strait Cook, and Mt. Cook. 

If Tiki doesn't rescue a kiwi in a limited amount of time, the devil will appear and try to kill her. When Tiki reaches the outskirts of each city, except Strait Cook, there is a boss waiting to meet Tiki, and kill her by using their own choice of weapons. Also making the rescue mission difficult are several nasties that attempt to throw their own weapons, like bombs and arrows, at her. To defeat these enemies, Tiki shoots at them using her crossbow and arrows. More often than not, when Tiki shoots at enemies, they will leave behind pieces of fruit that she can pick up for points. However, it is likely that Tiki may get other weapons or the letters E, X, T, E, N, and D. Collecting all these letters will result in an extra life, and as for the weapons, they include laser shots, bombs, and fireballs. 

In some levels, a few areas are located further up than just left or right, and the only way that Tiki can go up is by snatching something off the enemy that gives her the ability to fly up. Other areas are underwater, and when Tiki goes underwater, her oxygen  meter decreases, so she has to rise up to the surface again to restore her oxygen levels. Apart from her own weapons, Tiki is able to squirt water at enemies if she gets to the top of the water.

		<name>The Neverending Story</name>
		<desc>The Neverending Story is a text adventure based on the movie by Wolfgang Petersen (rather than the novel by Michael Ende).

The world of Fantasia is about to be destroyed by the "All-consuming Nothing", it needs someone from the "Real World" to believe in it again in order to be saved from falling into oblivion.

The player takes control of the young hero Atreyu who is the only one who can find the savior of Fantasia. The game uses different pictures to show the player's current location as well as the items he is holding, which companions are with him and any events that might be taking place. The game's parser has been deliberately kept simple (it has a vocabulary of about 40 words) in order to allow more room for the game data.

		<desc>The high-tech Terra Cresta ship should be capable of wiping out alien forces on a disputed planet. You're the pilot, and must shoot out every ship, defence tower and minefield you find as you fly around its surface. 

The action is viewed from above, scrolling only at the top, leaving you with a set journey to follow. You are limited to 2 bullets on screen at a time, so each shot should be tactically considered.

Power-ups are released by numbered buildings - shoot the building and then fly immediately in front of it to collect them. Once you have a a power-up Formation Mode, which gives you multiple firing positions as the ship splits of itself, is an option.

		<desc>The Self-Willed Extreme Environment Volitional Organism, or Sweevo for short, is a goofy-looking and generally incompetent robot. His world is Knutz' Folly, and it comprises almost 200 isometric-viewed screens of danger and challenge, making for a game influenced by Knightlore, although it takes a less serious approach to the genre. Sweevo can enter the world through four different vertical levels, and must use lifts and holes to cross through these to solve many puzzles.

You will meet some decidedly weird inhabitants. Most dangerous are the Dictators and Minxes - contact with these will drain Sweevo's energy, as will contact with water (he's a robot, remember). Energy can be recharged by scaring the Geese and picking up the tokens this reveals. The main score is a percentage, although several other totals are kept - most unusually 'Brownie Points', through contact with the brownies.

		<desc>It's Whodunit time in this licensed arcade adventure starring Sam Cruise. As Sam you must collect the clues by walking over them, with the hope of finding the killer. Money is an issue as well, as more can be collected, but it will be needed as the game goes on.

The city is awash with Gangsters, and neither they nor the police are happy with your methods or motives. Gangster bullets should be avoided if possible, as you only have the medical kits to repair the damage from 8 shots - fortunately a plethora of evasive moves are offered including rolls and somersaults. The police can be evaded by wearing disguises.

Many buildings can be entered and explored for clues, but leaving the lights on can alert people to your presence. Telephone calls play a big part in the game - initially you only have the number for your office, but this is a potential goldmine of clues, and more numbers can be obtained in a manner similar to Hacker.

		<desc>The original Match Day was the first serious football game to hit the Spectrum, and this sequel emerged over 2 years later. League and Cup tournaments for up to 8 teams (any or all of which can be human-controlled) are offered alongside one-off Friendly matches with a handicap option - passcodes are given to allow you to restore these to the same state another day.

Matches are seven-a-side, with variable lengths from 10 to 30 minutes. All kicks except set pieces are variable in strength using a Kick-o-meter which is displayed on screen. One revolutionary feature of the game was the Diamond Deflection System, which mathematically calculated the angle and pace of any rebounds.

Collecting herbs to cast spells is the main basis of the game. There are 24 herbs and flowers to be collected, which are used to make one of 12 spells (the herbs are only used for 1 spell, so there’s no need to decide which spell you’d prefer to have access to). You can use a combination of the spells (including a teleporter, invisibility and a fireball, which you must work our how to use). Leanoric’s direction relative to yourself is indicated by a compass.

		<desc>After rescuing the wizard Gimbal, the Magic Knight finds himself transported into the 25th century aboard the peaceful trade starship USS Pisces. He must find a way back to his own time.

Knight Tyme is the third game of the Magic Knight series. As in Spellbound, the previous game, the player interacts with the environment through the "Windimation" system: pressing a button brings up a window with a list of commands (pick up/drop/take/give an object, examine, command a character, read something, cast a spell and wear/unwear object). The player can scroll through these with the movement keys, and execute them with the same button used before. Spaceflight is part of the gameplay as the ship must visit several different planets. The spaceship has to be refueled, otherwise the character will be stuck forever in space. There are rooms that kill the knight instantaneously. Usually there is a puzzle associated with these rooms that must be solved in order to access them.

		<desc>This game was made just short of the 100th anniversary of England's most notorious serial killer, who gruesomely murdered at least five women in 1888. After accidentally killing someone, you become a suspect. You must prove that you are innocent, without the police hauling you in as they search for a scapegoat.

Jack the Ripper is interactive fiction with occasional graphics, based closely on real events of the Ripper. The parser accepts full sentences, and instructions can be qualified with adverbs such as 'slowly' and 'quietly'.  The game is split into three parts, including digitised graphics (of the author's sisters) representing Ripper victims.

		<name>Pang</name>
		<desc>Pang is a platform game which consists of 50 levels in total. It can be played with one or two players on the same screen, and the other player can join anytime within the game. 

Your goal is to destroy the balloons which bounce around the playfield. To accomplish this, you can shoot hooks which travel upwards, and blow up any balloon they touch. Depending on their size, they either split on two smaller ones, or evaporate if they're at their minimum size. Apart from balloons, some levels also have barriers that have to be destroyed with your hooks, since they often block your access to balloons. There are also some barriers which cannot ever be destroyed. Your character has the ability to climb ladders, but cannot jump. 

You can also pick up power-ups such as: the ability to fire two shots at once, the hook that attaches to the ceiling and waits 'til something bumps into it, a gun which has a high rate of fire but cannot destroy barriers. Beside extra weapons, you can also pick certain things like clock (halting time for a small period), dynamite (reducing all balls to minimum size, thus making you able to reach more points), life, and such.

In the 8-bit versions Hercules has some titanic tasks to complete, whilst in the 16-bit versions his daughter Yolanda has been cursed and can only free herself by completing the same tasks.

Unusually, the game’s dozens of screens are given in a random order, with a different one after you lose each life. You have no weapon with which to harm the various creatures that lurk within. The pace of the enemies is quite hectic, but the real unique feature is that you must keep moving – each platform is set on fire a few seconds after you first touch it.

		<path>./Vector Ball (Europe).tzx</path>
		<name>Vector Ball</name>
		<desc>This one on one future sport combines ideas from a number of real-world competitions, most notably the schoolgirl favourite Netball (I wonder why the ad blurb makes no mention of this?). The action is viewed isometrically, so moving the joystick up moves your droid north-east, down moves south-west, and so on.

The aim is to score more points than your opponent in each match, and be the first to win four matches (against either a human or computer opponent), before moving up to the next difficulty level. There is a goal in the middle at each end, and the ball can be advanced by shooting it (the length of a shot is affected by pushing the joystick up or down with fire pressed) as you can't run with the ball, or hold onto it for long. The main novel idea in the game is the shaping of the pitches, which are viewed in full 3D and have bumps and big divots all around.

		<name>Roller Coaster</name>
		<desc>A theme park may not seem like a typical platform game setting, compared to standards such as magical islands, abandoned castles and dank underground complexes. Elite's interpretation of setting a game there involves running and jumping through the complex to collect abandoned money.

The park features 60 screens, which are arranged in a non-linear way. They feature standard theme park attractions such as log flumes, big wheels and bumper cars. All of these can be jumped onto as they move, and can take you through the screens, either to get onto the next one quickly, or to help reach the awkwardly-placed money. You start with 10 lives, which can be lost through falling too far, or landing on water or fire hazards.

		<desc>Bounty Bob Strikes Back! is the sequel to Miner 2049er and features similar gameplay. As Bounty Bob, your goal is to claim every inch of 25 challenging mines. To do this, you must walk over each segment of the framework in the mines. To reach each segment of framework, you will need to figure out a way to jump, climb, or use one of the many devices occasionally available to get there. To you help you get around (or sometimes hinder progress) are ladders, slides, suction tubes, cannons, transporters, and other devices. Wandering about the mines are many dangerous mutants. If you come in contact with one of these, you will lose a life. Scattered throughout each mine are special food items; collect one of these, and you will temporarily be able to eliminate the mutants by walking into them. You will need to figure out a unique strategy for each level in order to complete it, plus there is a time limit so claim all the territory quickly!

		<desc>The classic game of chess against the computer.  The AI has ten skill levels and can effectively play both sides as the player can ask for recommendations which are calculated according to current level.  Moves are performed by typing in the coordinates and the game supports advanced moves like castling.

There is no way to save the game in progress but the screen can be copied to the ZX Printer with a single command.  The board can also be set up freely in order to test different scenarios or just to recall a game "saved" to a printout.

		<name>Fallen Angel</name>
		<desc>Fallen Angel is a side scrolling fighting game similar to Double Dragon. You play the fallen angel, sent on a mission to locate the leader of a drug distribution network. Beginning in the London underground, each level will present you with two tasks to complete: find a plane ticket to reach the next level, and destroy the ring leader of the area. To do this you will need to fight the (often well armed) thugs found in the various underground train stations and on the trains themselves. Each level consists of several stations; when all the thugs in a station are defeated, you may get on the train to go to a different station. The plane ticket you are searching for may be found in any one of these stations, and the level boss will be found in the last station. You are free to complete these two tasks in any order you choose, and don't need to visit the stations in any particular order. Fallen angel has the ability to perform a variety of kicks and punches to deal with the bad guys, and can occasionally pick up weapons.

		<desc>One of the first future sport simulations, Future Games involves five tough events on the surface of the moon. After each event, you have to drive to the next one across potentially hostile terrain using your skimmer.

The first event involves dodging through the defenses of a hostile computer system, with on-screen arrows guiding your route. The second is a super-charged game of dodge-ball – avoiding plasma spheres that are being fired at you, while the third involves shooting at everything from a target range. The fourth event entails destroying atomic badgers, while the final one involves running away (read ‘joystick-waggling’) from a hungry beast.

		<name>Scumball</name>
		<desc>The city's sewer system has been infested by monsters, and LINDA, a maintenance droid, has been sent down to flush them out with her laser gun. Different monsters have various effects on her: some will terminate LINDA on sight, while others simply drain her power. Her power can be replenished by getting batteries scattered around the sewers. Also, contact with other hazards such as water, spike pits, and pods results in her immediate termination.

LINDA may encounter a giant slime monster while navigating the sewers. Her primary objective is to destroy this monster, which take eight hits to kill. LINDA's laser gun will have no effect on the monster. So she has to collect eight grenades that are scattered around the sewers. LINDA can only carried one grenade at a given time.

LINDA begins with five lives, but extra lives are awarded in the sewers, as well as bonuses and mystery objects. A report card at the end of the game shows, among other things, kills made, lives lost and collected, the time of completion, final score, and overall progress.

		<desc>Life has never been too quiet in Marrakesh, but lately things have been getting harder.  Ait-Amar, the daughter of the sultan, has been kidnapped by a group of Berbers and they are forcing him to give half of his fortune within three days.

But as you know, with every kidnapping of a princess there's always an hero ready to rescue her, and Ben-Yussef, our protagonist, has been the chosen one this time to get into the labyrinthine and dangerous Kasbah in order to affront the kidnappers and rescue the handsome daughter of the Sultan.

As expected, it will be a hard task, because although there are some local residents willing to give clues in exchange for some coins, others will try to steal everything they can. Besides these two types of Moors, deep in the Kasbah there are women to which you can steal their money, policemen that will take your weapons, and thugs who are at the doors of the houses that you must enter in order to find the princess.

Like any human being, Ben-Yussef must replenish his strength in inns and restaurants and rest in hotels or hostels, implying a significant economic outlay. You can also buy new weapons in the armouries prepared to this effect, bearing in mind that depending on the neighborhood, these elements may also vary in price.

		<desc>This game covers the first 30 days of what was then feared to be the next war in Europe. You can choose to be the supreme commander of the NATO or the Warsaw Pact. In your control are air and ground units. These are backed up by your ability to make strategic nuclear/chemical attacks.

As the Warsaw Pact commander your task is to break the lines of the NATO alliance, which you see is a powerful invasion force, poised on your border. Your first task is to take over West Germany.

As NATO commander your task is to stop the Russian invasion. Hold the lines on West Germany's border. You will achieve this by preventing the occupation of West Germany.

Your computer opponent can play in three different ways. Nuclear weapons can be disabled for a Beginner game, while the thought processes can be either rational or unpredictable.

Gameplay is turn-based and primarily strategic, but some scenes can be played out in optional action sequences.

		<name>Pac-Man</name>
		<desc>One of the most popular and influential games of the 1980's, Pac-Man stars a little, yellow dot-muncher who works his way around to clear a maze of the various dots and fruit which inhabit the board.

Pac-Man's goal is continually challenged by four ghosts: The shy blue ghost Bashful (Inky), the trailing red ghost Shadow (Blinky), the fast pink ghost Speedy (Pinky), and the forgetful orange ghost Pokey (Clyde).  One touch from any of these ghosts means a loss of life for Pac-Man.

Pac-Man can turn the tables on his pursuers by eating of the four Energizers located within the maze.  During this time, the ghosts turn blue, and Pac-Man can eat them for bonus points.  This only lasts for a limited amount of time, as the ghost's eyes float back to their center box, and regenerate to chase after Pac-Man again.

Survive a few rounds of gameplay, and be treated to humorous intermissions between Pac-Man and the ghosts.

		<name>Oriental Games</name>
		<desc>The Oriental Games offer skilled martial artists the chance to prove themselves in Kung Fu, Kendo and the relatively brutal Kyo-Kus-Hin-Kai., using “courage, skill and flare” (sic) according to the packaging. It makes for a series of one-on-one fights viewed from the side.

Kendo involves using a stick as your weapon, whereas Kung Fu various punches and kicks and Kyo-Kus-Hin-Kai involves head butts and flying attacks. You can jump over opponents; a quick tap of the fire button turns you around. You have an energy bar with 5 blocks of gradually decreasing colours, which drops when you are hit and increases as you pass time without being hit. Impressive moves earn you bonus Merit Awards.

On the 16-bit versions, there are 3 skill levels (Novice, Professional and Master), digitised sound, and an editor to set up joystick moves. The 8-bit versions lack these niceties, but include an extra discipline, Sumo; these are played in sequence rather than by choice.

		<name>Krakout</name>
		<desc>Arkanoid-style Breakout clone, which unlike most other similar games has the bat on the side of the screen (there is a left/right option) instead of at the bottom.

There are a number of types of special bricks, but unlike e.g. Arkanoid, they do not fall towards the bat. Instead, when you hit a special brick, it flips to show a letter. E.g. E (Extend bat), C (Catch ball), M (Missile), B (Bomb, explodes when hit by ball, clearing a number of bricks) and X (Extra life).

The enemies/obstacles are more varied than in Arkanoid. Some make the bat freeze, some actually chew and eat your ball and spit out the core back at you!

The Mu-ans decided to take action. They asked their best scientists to come up with a weapon that will defeat the Galdens. After many long months, they were able to develop a vehicle of immense firepower, capable of leaping into the air to avoid ground hazards. In addition to that, it can transform into an airborne vessel whose purpose is to eliminate any kind of enemy in the sky.

Players have to guide their vehicle through six difficult levels - alternating between ground vehicle and fighter plane – while destroying every Galden that gets in their way. While progressing, holes in the ground need to be avoided, as players lose one of their ships should they happen to fall through one. Shooting power pods scattered around the level allows the player to increase their firepower. However, they lose that firepower if one of their ships is destroyed.

		<name>Driller Tanks</name>
		<desc>Driller Tanks features a side-on view of the tank you control, which is submerged in a maze full of nasties known as Mammuts and Skorks. The aim is to first shoot them, then run them over, within a limited period of time before they wake up and reactivate. 

You must walk through a particular section of maze to make it accessible for this, as any shot fired into the initial blue barriers will have no effect. At all times you must watch to ensure that none of the Mammuts reach the palace by travelling to the top of the screen. The Skorks are less harmful, but contact with them in their unfrozen state is still fatal, and they refill areas you have cleared.

You must pilot your craft through some of the hardest levels ever created and shoot down all the enemy space craft and ground weapons, and avoid the many indestructible hazards. 

The innovation is that you do not simply travel in a single direction, but instead move from left to right or right to left depending on where the current targets are, in a manner more similar to Defender than most shoot 'em ups.

The game offers pictures of each location and significant objects, and a textual description of each location, but beyond this the game system is atypical of 1980s adventures, especially those originating on cassette. A set of icons is displayed in the top half of the screen, which are selected to activate movement, item manipulation, analysing the scene (by selecting specific words of text), and actions like ascending, throwing and swimming. Puzzle solving always uses objects either in the scene description or your inventory.

		<name>Mad Mix 2: En el castillo de los fantasmas</name>
		<desc>Peace had arrived finally at "Cocovillage" thanks to the good work made by Mad Mix, who had become the worthy successor of his grandfather. But the nightmare had still not finished, because a few miles away, in the town of his cousin Ope, "Cococastle" (a place crowned by a phantasmagoric Castle), it was happening a strange phenomena. All the indications made think that a "coco", survivor of "Cocovillage", had converted the Castle into his dwelling, establishing in addition a maleficent alliance with the sinister inhabitants from that place. The terror had seized the inhabitants of "Cococastle", and only Mad can give back the tranquillity to the pacific inhabitants of this village.

The game consists in eating all the "coconuts" (small ball species that are dispersed through all the Castle) which appear at every moment. Once you have finished with all the coconuts of the level you will pass to the following stay of the Castle of the Ghosts, this is the mechanic until you have been able to explore all its corners. However, you shouldn't care only in eating all the "coconuts", but in addition you will have to be very kind trying to not collide with any of the inhabitants of the terrific Castle, as well as to avoid the different traps (or using them in your own benefit) while taking helpful -some with really curious effects- objects.

		<desc>"Death Star Battle" is loosely based on the events of "Star Wars, Part 6: Return of the Jedi". Your task is to destroy the Death Star before its construction is finished. You start the task outside the shield perimeter of the Death Star. There you'll have to combat different imperial vessels and avoid the death ray while waiting for an opportunity to slip through one of the random openings in the energy shield. After reaching the Death Star you must reduce its structure up to the point where you can hit the core. In the following blow up of the station you must avoid collision with Death Star debris.

After successful destruction the game will restart with increased difficulty (faster enemies, faster Death Star build up, etc).

Overall difficulty can also be adjusted before starting the game.

You will have to jump and duck the dragons fireballs as well as avoid flying arrows to reach the other side! In the second part you need to collect all of the treasures on the screen and make it to the exit while avoiding the dragon who runs across the bottom of the screen. The dragons on each level have different patterns of movement and firing, and as the levels progress will become faster and trickier.

		<desc>With April O'Neil held hostage by The Shredder's thugs, Bebop and Rocksteady, once again, it's up to the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles to come to her rescue!  Play as all four of the turtle heroes, rescue April, and then rescue your sensei Splinter from Mecha-Turtles clutches than go after The Shredder deep in the bowels of The Technodrome itself.

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is an action game based on the late eighties/early nineties cartoon series of the same name. Play as Leonardo, Michaelangelo, Donatello and Raphael (one turtle only, but the ability to swap between turtles at any time) as you save your friends and battle The Shredder and his cronies. There are no 'lives', as such - when you lose a turtle, he becomes 'captured', and you cannot use him again until you rescue him from a place hidden in the overworld.

Gameplay takes place in two perspectives: a top-down view, which lets you run around and explore buildings, sewers and other places. When entering places from the top-down view, the perspective shifts to a side-scrolling view, where most of the battling takes place. In addition to each turtle's main weapon, sub-weapons (such as shuriken) can be acquired, to use at foes - these have a limited use.

Osiris' son Horus though rose up and defeated your Father and threw him out of the Other World, while his relatives including you are banished to become mortal and live amongst men. As you are innocent in all this some Gods have decided to help you and so tell you about a nearly forgotten manuscript called the Book of the Dead. It describes how a mortal soul can travel after dieing, to the Other World, and is written in tomes, appears on tomb walls and is in the minds of some priests and beings. Horus has heard about the book and so has put a curse on yourself which gives you a crippling disease which will kill you long before you find all the text and undergo the rites of purification to get your soul back to being a Godling. As well as the book you have to find Gods who will help you by giving you a cure.

Book of the Dead is a graphic text adventure where the screen has text describing your location while a picture shows you what you can see. You type in commands with the keyboard to interact with your surroundings and other people or Gods.</desc>

Out of the ashes comes a hero, Jonathan Rogers, better known as "Jungle Rogers", the owner of the asphalt jungle. The only chance of survival is to reach the airdrop platform XV-238, located in the control base of the schizophrenic assassin professor McJerin, and to escape to outer colonies.

There is no easy way to do this. The game is a side-scrolling shoot 'em up, with thugs coming at you constantly, and a few moves to use on them. You must cross the dangerous streets of Manhattan, which have become over-run by feral thieves. Later he awaits for the guardians of the scientific complex of McJerin.

		<desc>You are a solitary adventurer, chosen by the sage Yaztromo to save the land of Allansia from Malbordus, the sinister champion of the Dark Elves, by beating him through the inhospitable wastes of the Desert of Skulls to the fabulous lost city of Vatos.  There you must brave cruel monsters, ancient deathtraps, fanatical disciples of the cult of Leesha, and the cat-and-mouse depredations of the sinister killer known as the Messenger of Death in your quest to recover the powerful Dragon artefacts before Malbordus can find them and utilise their mystical power to fuel his campaign of carnage.

A loose adaptation (using many of the original's characters, locations, situations and puzzles but often in new configurations) of Ian Livingstone's Fighting Fantasy gamebook #14, published two years prior, this computer game version merges the gamebook's Choose-Your-Own-Adventure design to the Adventure International text-game-with-graphics model developer Adventure Soft had grown familiar with republishing.  This curious hybrid yields some alternate puzzle solutions that wouldn't have been possible in the original gamebook format, but often imposes extraneous constraints such as carry limits and step-by-step sequences of actions that the book would have effortlessly bundled together in a single multiple-choice paragraph selection.  Curiously, considering the ease with which computers automate data management, the designers chose to reject the trademark Fighting Fantasy SKILL, STAMINA, LUCK RPG stats-management -- distancing the conversion from unfair elements of randomness but placing a new emphasis on adventure game inventory puzzles.

A version of this game also came out for the BBC Micro.

		<name>Phantomas</name>
		<desc>Phantomas is a Jet Set Willy influenced platform game consisting of 80 rooms. The task is to reach a millionaire's mansion and 'borrow' as much as possible from it. First you must reach the mansion by passing through a junkyard, then negotiate the palace and its maze of traps, then escape through underground caverns. You have a single life, contact with enemies will drain this gradually, but squares of energy can be collected en route. You get transport between levels in different ways, including rockets and helicopters.

		<name>Bonanza Bros</name>
		<desc>Mobo and Robo Bonanza are enjoying their favorite television show when the picture crackles and a shadowy figure of a mysterious stranger appears on screen. This figure asks them to collect certain items that he has placed inside various buildings to test his security force. If they return the items successfully, Mobo and Robo will be rewarded. The two of them state that they will get the job done in just three minutes. However, little do they know that each building is packed with security guards who will raise the alarm if they are caught red-handed. Fortunately both Mobo and Robo are equipped with bullets that can knock the guards unconscious for a few seconds. An $100 reward will be given out if Mobo and Robo are apprehended.

As either Mobo or Robo, you must collect all the treasures before leaving the ten buildings and shoot any security guards that get in your way. Remember that you are under a time limit. An in-game map will help you locate the treasures. There is a bonus stage after three buildings, where the object is to collect the gold bars in a limited amount of time without  one of the three spotlights shining on you. If it is possible, hide behind open doors. If you manage to get all the gold bars, 10,000 points is added to your score. There are three of these bonus stages, but each of them varies.

		<name>The Pawn</name>
		<desc>The aim of this interactive fiction with graphics is to escape from the land of Kerovnia, where strange occurrences are routine. The Roobikyoub dwarves have been banished from the kingdom, which is not good as they produce high-quality whisky. King Erik is not popular for this decision, as some feel that ale brewers and mineral water bottlers have influenced him. Honest John the trader and Kronos the Magician play a key role in your journey, each offering sub-quests to attempt.

The package includes a novella complete with map and decipherable hints, which are accessed by typing 'hint' followed by the code into the computer. Therefore, those with only a pirated copy would struggle to complete the game.

Your score and the number of locations visited are both displayed in the title bar. The parser allows whole words to be deleted and unaccepted previous entries to be re-edited.

		<desc>An early attempt at a strategy war game with a loosely fictitious setting, although the game map resembles the coastline of northern Europe. The planning and deploying stage of the battle has been handled for you - your units are all in position and ready to attack or defend. The main factor of the game region is that most of it is covered by a river, with only one bridge, the guarding of which is of huge strategic importance - although there are also different gradients to consider. Two map zooms are provided, one for a wider impression of the area and the other for a close view of the individual units. Information about the progress of the war and individual battles is constantly being provided.

		<name>Star Wars II - The Empire Strikes Back</name>
		<desc>The arcade game from Atari Games based on the second Star Wars movie features four action sequences inspired by the film. The graphical style is similar to the first Star Wars game, using vector graphics with a first-person perspective.

The first sequence takes place on the ice planet Hoth, where the player must destroy Imperial probe droids. The droids send transmissions to the Empire that can also be targeted and destroyed. Once enough transmissions have been sent, the Empire attacks.

In the second sequence, the player has to fend off Imperial walkers, either by shooting a limited number of tow cables at their feet or by targeting a small area at their head with lasers. But sooner or later, the Rebel base's power generator will be destroyed and the evacuation begins.

In the third sequence, the Millennium Falcon has to destroy TIE Fighters in space.

In the fourth and final sequence, the Falcon must navigate through an asteroid field, avoiding collisions.

Once the four sections have been completed, the game restarts at a higher difficulty level.

		<desc>A more accurate title for this would be "Horace Goes Skiing, but only if he can brave a Frogger clone first", as you start the game by having to reach the ski shop to get skis, and then get back across to reach the slopes. The road is full of cars and bikes, contact with each of which costs $10 in ambulance fees out of your starting $40, and the skis themselves cost $10.

The actual skiing section has a pseudo-3D view, similar to a roving camera mounted above the course. Your task is to cut between the red and blue sets of flags, without hitting any of the trees on the course. Light contact with these will allow you to carry on; heavy contact breaks your skis and sends you back to the first section of the game (which you also return to after completing each of the courses).

		<desc>Shadow Dancer is a one-player game in which you control Shinobi. With the help of your dog, you must kill your enemies while you venture through locations such as airports, railroads, waterfalls, sewers, and more.  Furthermore, you must find and disarm several bombs along the way before you leave each. You also have the option of using magic against enemies, which may consist of tornadoes or fireballs.

There are five missions you must complete; and each one has different objectives such as obstructing the enemies deadly mission, disrupting the enemy's supply route, raiding the enemy's industrial units, attacking the enemy's underground forces, and liberating and securing the shuttle's base. Each mission consists of three stages and there is a boss on each of the mission's final stages. 

What's good about the dog, you say? Well, if you tell it to, the dog will maul enemies (provided that the dog barks at them when you face them) and distract them long enough so that you can shoot at them. Remember that you have a limited time to do this, as the enemy will eventually kick the dog off him. This causes the dog to yelp and shrink, making him powerless against them.

		<desc>A licensed game based around the cult comic strip character, recreating his daring attempts to defeat Mekon and save the earth.

The Anastasia ship is attacked by the Treens as soon as Dan steps onto it, although fortunately he picks up a laser on board. From then on, he must act as fast as possible.

The main task is to find each of the 5 parts of a planetary-destruction mechanism to the control room, so that it can be safely diffused. He can only carry one at a time, and once he gets the back he must find the correct socket for each one. Lastly he must escape to the surface.

Contact with a Treen will see Dan kidnapped and placed in the prison area; he can get out easily enough, but will now be in a different place. Getting hit by gun blasts will weaken him gradually.

		<path>./Wizball (Europe).tzx</path>
		<name>Wizball</name>
		<desc>In Wizball the player takes the role of the friendly wizard Wiz who can turn himself into a green ball that is able to defend his world against the color-sucking enemies who have turned his once brightly colored Wizworld into a drab planet. With his trusty feline companion Catelite, the wizard will restore the colors to the world by retrieving them from defeated enemies.

The player starts out as a bouncing green ball that can shoot and be put into more or less heavy rotation to move slowly or faster, physically correct through the side-scrolling levels. The first task is to upgrade the ball by shooting the first non-moving enemies, and collect the green bubbles that are left by them. In order to stand a chance against the following moving enemy waves, some upgrades are a must. First and foremost, complete control over the ball should be activated (i.e. flying through the levels), a shield sheltering the top and bottom of the player's should be acquired, and two-way fire (left/right) should be obtained.

But the extra needed to advance in Wizball is your friend Catelite who will, once summoned, take the form of a small green satellite that will imitate the ball's movement, or can be directly controlled by the player. Besides upping Wiz' fire power, Catelite is able to collect paint drops left by a certain kind of defeated enemies until the respective color pot is filled up. There's three colors available (red, green and blue), and several different combinations of them must be collected to complete a level and restore it to former colorfulness. Every color combination collected will send Wiz to a bonus stage, then to his laboratory where one of the power-ups can be made permanently.

The game also features a bunch of multi-player modes, there's even a two-player cooperative mode amongst them.

		<name>Indoor Sports</name>
		<desc>Four Indoor Sports are compiled in this entry to DesignStar's SportTime line of recreations. Ten-Pin Bowling, Air Hockey, Darts and (except on the Commodore 64) Ping Pong are featured. The menus and options screens have the same feel as Clubhouse Sports. Each game has computer opponents at multiple skill levels plus human-versus-human and demo modes, and matches can consist of varying numbers of rounds, with other options depending on the game.

Ten-pin bowling is played from a side-on view, although once the shot has been taken you see the results unfold from the bowler's view. There are three stages to taking a shot. Move the player up and down to line up his run-up, pressing fire to set the position. Then, do the same to set the angle of the shot. Finally, after pressing fire to start the run-up, press it again to time the release of the ball, as close to the line as possible.

Darts has 4 skill and 3 speed levels, and players can play to 301, 501 or 701, to vary game length or provide a handicapping system. You can also set whether scoring must start or end with a double. Viewed from behind the board, you must first line up the dart, then set the dart's curvature and power by stopping a curved gauge on the right, then a rising power bar on the left. The view then changes twice - first a behind-the-player view to show the dart's approach, then a close-up of the board to show where it landed.

Air Hockey plays for five minutes, or until someone has scored 12 points. The view is above the pitch but angled so as to emphasize the goal at the top.

Ping-Pong features a handicapping system - six ability areas can be graded from 1-5, to ensure a closely-matched game. Again the view is from behind one court. To impart direction onto a shot, the angle must be pressed at the same time as the fire button.

		<name>Super Hang-On</name>
		<desc>This is a conversion of Sega's popular motorcycle racing arcade game.  In this game you race a motorcycle around the world, completing each section of track within a time limit. There are other bikes on the road, but beating this is not important, so they can be thought of as moving obstacles. Each continent is a different difficulty level: Africa is beginner, Asia is junior, the Americas are senior, and Europe is expert.  

This is a very simple and straightforward game, viewed from behind the bike in 2D (so the screen does not tilt with the bike). The right/left controls are steering, and up/down are gear changes. Your cycle is always moving, and your speed strictly depends on the gear you are in, although contact or running off the road slows the bike down.

		<path>./Komando II (Slovakia).z80</path>
		<name>Komando II</name>
		<desc>It's obvious right from the title that Komando II was inspired by the classic Commando. The main objective of this game is to guide your soldier through the eight territories contaminated by deadly radioactivity. At the end of the last territory is a helicopter that will take you back to your homeland – Slovakia. 

Each territory is filled with military installments so expect to see a lot of bunkers, watchtowers, tents, hangars, fences, foxholes, vehicles and also one tank. You start the game armed with a bunch of grenades and the "Curevoj" machine gun (equipped with an unlimited ammunition) but it's possible to get some special weapons. Just find a bound prisoner (there are few in every territory), release him free and you'll be awarded with a limited supply of grenades, bazooka or flamethrower. All these weapons will be really useful because the number of enemies is endless and they're not only shooting but sometimes also throwing grenades or playing with the flamethrower. There are also two main differences compared to original Commando – your soldier won't die during the contact with enemy soldiers and the game is time limited. This time limit is represented by slowly but constantly growing % of radioactivity so don't stop and move forward or the game is over.

		<desc>To escape the Planet of Steps, Pogo must paint each of the 28 steps set colour on each of the 16 levels of what boils down to a Q*Bert-style game. On the first four levels he must only step on each square once to change its colour, after that this must be done twice. Trying to stop Pogo are a range of enemies including glass balls (which comes down from the top), scorpions (which move from side-to-side) and snakes (which pursue Pogo). There are flying saucers at the side of the screen - jump onto these to return to the top of the screen. After completing each level a bonus is awarded.

In each level you must collect a certain number of these diamonds, in order to open a portal to the next stage. Enemies can be squashed by falling boulders, which are released when the ground below them is removed or they are pushed onto empty ground, but be careful because these can also squash you. In later levels, difficulty is increased by many puzzle elements and shorter time limits.

		<desc>Kinetik is an arcade adventure which features gravity, inertia and other real physics heavily. You control a round spaceship, which must be guided through the 44+ screens. Collect the letters P,A and X in that order and reach the end to win.

There are foes to avoid or shoot – some take objects you have but most merely drain some of your energy. Some walls can also be shot out. Some rooms have white spots which affect gravity and drag you inwards.

Avoid contact with red walls as these drain energy; all others are harmless. There are teleporters to help you navigate the game, and power-ups which remove the complex physics.

		<desc>Army Moves is a one-player game which is divided into two parts. In part one, you drive a jeep and must avoid collision with other jeeps and being shot at by helicopters. Then, you fly around in a helicopter and the oject is to bring down airplanes without being shot at by the airplanes themselves, submarines, and any other ground fire. Make sure you land on the pad near the end.

In part two, you start out in the jungle and must jump from rock to rock without crashing into toucans (shoot at them to make them fly higher) and being blown to bits. Then you have to make your way to the general's offices shooting soldiers on the way, and finally, locate the secret documents. When you complete the seven sections of Army Moves, you'll receive a higher bonus.

Some versions have a high score table to record your achievements. The second section must be loaded seperately, using a code attained from completing part one, on some versions.

You have been sent down mines, to explore 50 screens, on each of which you must collect a key and reach the exit. You also have to pick up a sacred artifact on every 5th level.

Your character is very bouncy, requiring small movements in order to keep control. You can shoot at the surrounding enemies and collect weapons, although the initial one only shoots horizontally. There are many pickups on offer, including extra lives, bounciness boosts and opposition-slowers.

		<desc>With a clear James Bond influence, Sly Spy must stop terrorists destroying parts of the city in this collection of sub-games. Roughly half of these (starting with level 2, and alternating from there on) are side-scrolling Green Beret-influenced offerings, not entirely dissimilar to a great many Ocean movie licenses. There are bad guys to shoot and bullets to avoid, with boxes to climb up on and strategic positions to shoot from behind cover.

The first level involves skydiving down the screen and shooting at the agents as they themselves fall - complete this and you'll safely parachute to the ground. There's a motorbike chase, in which you must shoot out and dodge agents. Two underwater levels follow, in which more enemies and some sharks must be shot. Before reaching the final multiple-enemy showdown in a missile factory full of the baddies from the game.

		<desc>The Blodroid Empire has launched a mass attack on Earth. Fortunately, its entire network of ships use shields powered remotely from a single generator located on their homeworld. As a feared pilot, you must fly your Astrohunter spaceship through hostile territory to destroy it.

The journey is viewed from above. The threat is from nine increasingly-tough Supercruisers, which have the ability to launch spaceships, missiles and mines. These must all be avoided or shot out. In this part of the game, you have four lives, represented by shields which deplete as you take hits.

The last Supercruiser contains the six all-important Generator panels. This final phase of the game takes place on foot, as you destroy them with projectiles. You must then return to your ship before everything explodes and takes you with it.

The game is controlled by moving MSB directly, with a teleport facility on the droid allowing you to move one object at a time. Spanner-type devices are mounted from the floor - guiding MSB into the top of these reveals puzzles which can be used to unlock doors to reach other sections of the ship. Before any power can be generated and the ship's scanner accessed, a leak must be fixed by finding and using a piece of spare piping.

		<desc>After Bored of the Rings parodied JRR Tolkien's classic Lord of the Rings series, Delta 4 did the same thing with its predecessor The Hobbit, preceding New Line Cinema's identical sequence by 20 years. There is a logical 3-part structure to the adventure, but there are also jokes such as the Old Ford location on the map being near a New Ford - a new Ford Sierra car.

This interactive fiction with graphics game thus features reluctant adventurer Bimbo Faggins and devious magician Grandalf attempting to gain treasure, ultimately by appearing on a TV game show. VERB NOUN inputs are used for most instructions, although you have to TALK someone before SAYing anything to them. EXAMINEing objects is crucial to progress, and to finding the best jokes.

As well as the famous Monaco course, others from around the world have been added, to give the game a longer shelf life. You must complete qualification sessions and the races as fast as possible.

The Genesis version of Super Monaco adds a complete career mode, however.  In the career mode, your goal is to win a season of races. Unfortunately, you start with a relatively slow car.  By challenging other drivers, you can move to a better team and car, and ultimately win the F1 World Title.

The game features 12 levels split into three distinct styles. First of all you'll be flying over a city in your helicopter, shooting out tanks by ducking low enough to target them, but also climbing to avoid the skyscrapers in the area. The third section is viewed similarly, but sees you attempting to wipe out the planes mounted on an aircraft carrier.

The second section is viewed behind your helicopter in full 3D, and adds helicopters and planes to be shot, with dodging their bullets as you duck down to shoot the tanks being the main challenge.

		<desc>Count Chameleon recognises the importance of the game of cricket to the power of the British Empire, and knows that a simple Rubbertronic Ray to scupper the ball's bounce is all it takes to bring their power down. You control the team of Viscount Stifflip, Professor Braindeath, Colonel R G Bargie and Miss Primbottom, as they attempt to stop him.

The bulk of the game is icon-driven, and allows you to switch between the four characters at will. The control options are all described in slangy English terms, so instead of talking to characters you 'Chinwag' with them, and fights are called 'Fisticuffs'. These are a key aspect of the game, requiring prompt arcade reactions and correct move selection, especially as using the low blow too often results in a character being wiped out.

		<name>Plummet</name>
		<desc>The Mayor of New York has gone to open the city's latest skyscraper, but has got stuck in the malfunctioning lift. As a Superhero for hire, you must climb the building using the stairs, and bring enough ropes to be able to tie the lift up and winch it down safely.

The levels of the building are portrayed across 3 screens, scrolling vertically. You must pick up one of the many ropes which are located throughout the floors, take it up to the top of the shaft on the third screen, then collect another and do the same.

You'll have to suspend your disbelief a little with regard to the hazards stopping you doing this - security men who must be shot (why aren't they on your side?) (you can only shoot while in possession of a rope, by the way); falling bits of ceiling on the top screen (rather shoddy building?); and fire doors which are fatal to the touch unless you shoot them open.

		<name>Back to the Future</name>
		<desc>Based on the 1985 time travel flick, Electric Dreams' Back to the Future for the Commodore 64 (and ported to the ZX Spectrum) differs significantly from LJN's version on the NES.

The player takes control of teenager Marty McFly; zapped into the past by an experiment gone wrong. To preserve Marty's future existence, the player must lure Marty's mother-to-be into spending more time with his father, while avoiding the school bully. These computer-controlled characters will wander the game areas and interact with each other according to basic rules - Marty's mother will follow him around, his father will avoid the bully, the bully will knock Marty out if their paths should cross, etc.  If left to their own devices, Marty's parents will not meet and his time will run out (indicated by a fading family photo).  

The game world consists of five distinct areas, each the size of one screen. A separate &amp;quot;hub&amp;quot; area scrolls past the entrances to these five zones. Each of the five areas holds a collectable item, with a different effect (attract, repel, or no effect) on each character. A skateboard can also be collected to travel across the hub faster.

The player must use their collected items to keep Marty's mother and father in close proximity, while also keeping the bully away.

		<path>./Mikie (Europe).tzx</path>
		<name>Mikie</name>
		<desc>Mikie puts you in charge of Mikie, a high school student who likes to win hearts of every girl that he can lay his eyes on. 

There are several classrooms to explore like the Quantum Physics Room, Locker Room, Canteen, the Aerobics Dancing Class, and the Playground. In each classroom, Mikie has to collect all the hearts that are found in each classroom to form a message. In order to collect these hearts, Mikie must stand somewhere near them and shout out. There are two type of hearts: small  and large. Mikie needs to shout out only once to collect the small hearts, and multiple times to collect the large ones. When a message is formed, Mikie can exit the classroom through a door marked OUT.

Stopping him from collecting the hearts is the teacher, the chef, and the janitor. The teacher is the worst one. When he is unable to  catch you, he works up a sweat, and eventually, throws his teeth at you. When his teeth hits Mikie, he loses one of his three lives. In later classrooms, Mikie can throw stuff at his enemies in order to stun them for several seconds (for instance, the basketballs in the locker room, and the chickens in the canteen). The janitor isn't as bad because he walks much slower than the others.

In between levels, you have to enter the next classroom through a door marked IN without being caught, but you can do at least two things to pass time: Steal some lunch, and open one of the unmarked doors to receive a punch, a kick, or the chance to see a naked lady with breasts. Beware that if you take too long in the hallway and don't travel between floors, a bucket slides across the screen real fast and attempt to slip you.

If you're good enough at the game, you can enter a high score, and if you fail to enter anything, the game will assume that you are Clint Eastwood.

		<name>Deflektor</name>
		<desc>There's plenty of reflection in this game, in both senses of the word. That's because this strategic puzzler involves using mirrors to direct a beam of light across a succession of 60 screens. Each mirror has 16 different angles it can be set at, each of which will send the beam around the screen in different ways.

Before the exit is activated, all the mines on a screen must be cleared by running the beam over them. There are other devices built into the levels, including teleports and random angle-changers, as well as hazards to avoid (they cause the beam to overheat) and droids which go around moving the mirrors' directions.

		<name>The Mystery of the Nile</name>
		<desc>In this unofficial adaptation of the film "The Jewel of the Nile", three travelers have been captured by a dictatorial regime in an Arab country. They must escape the country at once, and the player is the only one who can help them.

In the initial screens all three tourists need to be reunited from their different prison cells. Each character also needs to find their weapon of choice, those being grenades, a pistol and an umbrella. Control between any of the travelers can be switched at any moment by typing 1, 2 or 3.

Once the three travelers are reunited, every screen acts as a puzzle of sorts: the player is given a few seconds to strategically place each character before enemies appear. When they do, two of the characters will react automatically to the enemies, and the player will directly control the last character. If all enemies in the screen are eliminated and the three characters survive, they will advance to the next screen.

		<desc>While few young people aspire to the role of a Dustman, New Generation Software felt they would enjoy pretending to be one on this innovative arcade game.

Each section presents you with a road of houses, drawn from forced-perspective 3D, with flick-scrolling as you move up the road. Each house's dustbin must be collected, emptied and replaced within the time limit, which is indicated by the Bonus timer at the top of the screen. If this reaches zero, you receive the first of 3 warnings -  a third sees you out of a job.

Setting foot on the grass causes the onus to drop more quickly, and there are additional hazards to avoid, including the local cars, which appear to be driven by maniacs, and cyclists and barking dogs, which can both injure you and cause your movement to slow.

In this game, players control Kwon, dubbed the Human Killing Machine. He has vowed to demonstrate the power of his homeland; and does this by battling a series of opponents in several countries such as Moscow, Amsterdam, and Barcelona. HKM uses the term 'knockdown' for players who defeat their current opponent. Three knockdowns are needed for the player to move onto the next opponent.

Bonus points are awarded for the remaining energy Kwon has when he has successfully defeated his opponent. The player has five lives, and if all of them are used up, the game is over.

		<desc>The Sinu tribe of South America have long been a mystery to explorers. Their God Xipe Totec demanded regular human sacrifices to retain his power, and he is still feared when Sir Pericles Pemberton-Smythe heads off to investigate his tomb. He disappears, leading his daughter Daphne to assemble a team to track him down, which is where the player comes in.

The team is made up of Daphne, her fiance Professor Kite, a drunken journalist known as 'Legless' O'Donnell, and her trusty dog Frozbie. You can control any of these in turn, and order them to lead the other members of the team. The Professor is the smartest at solving the puzzles you will encounter, Daphne takes after her father as a natural explorer, O'Donnell is physical strong, and Frozbie is good at rooting around uncovering hidden objects.

The Tombs are isometrically-viewed, with the perspective revealing some areas and concealing others. Zombies and other monsters wandering through the tomb must be avoided.

Each member can carry 3 objects, which are used to solve these puzzles - some objects are limited to certain characters. Options such as switching character, movement mode and object use are activated by pressing fire to bring up a menu, and using left and right to select the option.

		<desc>The archetype of the Hunchback of Notre Dame really isn't terribly nuanced: he jumps around towers, ringing bells, rescuing Esmeralda and being generally physically unattractive.  Here he does all of these things, in a more platform-oriented take than the original, clambering up dangling ropes as they rise and fall, avoiding environmental threats such as rabid bats, thrown hatchets and enormous grinding clockwork gears all in the pursuit of small bells strewn across each screen's platforms.  Gathering all the bells permits you to advance higher up the tower, at the top of which the damsel in distress awaits your homely visage.

		<name>Rebel Star - 1 Player</name>
		<desc>A turn-based, tactical squad combat game for one or two players, from the creator of the later X-COM series.

Moonbase Delta may look like an unassuming mining colony, but in fact, it is the secret location of the ISAAC super-computer, used by the Empire to break the Rebels' secret codes. The Rebelstar Raiders' mission is to break in, get past the patrolling robot guards and destroy the computer. It won't be easy.

Your Raiders each have a specific number of action points per move, which can be allocated to movement, firing and object manipulation. Keys, medical kits and repair droids are among the available objects. Shots can be precise, point-blank (less points used, but less prospect of success), wide-range, or opportunist.

		<name>Death Wish 3</name>
		<desc>The actor Charles Bronson played the iconic role of vigilante Paul Kersey in 5 movies where he takes the law into his own hands when he doesn't get justice and criminals get off.  This game is based on Death Wish 3 which came out in 1985.  A friend of Kersey in New York has been killed and he takes to the streets to help the police lay waste to gangs that are brutalizing and rioting in the city.

He has a bulletproof vest that will protect him from several shots and can wield 4 guns: the 475 Wildey Magnum, shotgun, machine gun, and rocket launcher.  Avoid shooting grannies on the streets, mean street-walkers and the police who occasionally will help you take out the baddies.  If you start shooting policemen, they will turn on you too.    
The upper half of the screen shows you the side-view of the street or building you are in.  The lower half shows your score, high score, injury meter, a scrolling police report so you can know where crime is taking place, a compass direction, a map which will also show you where weapons and bosses are located, and which weapon you are holding and the ammo left.  
When you enter a building, you can fire out the window for higher points but beware of enemies that may come up behind you.

		<desc>Kick Off was the first football game of its kind, having a top down view and unlike other football games of that time the ball was not glued to the feet of the players. Playing Kick Off requires skills in boll control. There is an option to learn these skills without being harassed by the opposition. The set pieces like corner kicks, passing, sliding tackles and dribbling can be practiced to perfection. Each player on the pitch has a unique combination of 4 attributes, namely Pace, Stamina, Accuracy and Aggression. As you progress you will need to adapt to to different types of players. You can play in a league consisting of 8 teams. The teams in the league are on the whole evenly matched but have different styles of play with players attribute to match that style. There is 12 different referees in the game.

Smashing at the edges of the buildings for long enough will make them collapse. The police and military are after you, and will shoot at you, so try to destroy them (failing that, you can avoid the bullets). You will need to eat regularly, with things like plants on offer, to avoid shrinking back to being human

		<name>Dun Darach</name>
		<desc>Dun Darach may be the first ever videogame prequel – to Tir Na Nog. As such, it features the warrior Cuchulainn of Muirmethne, in a war against the Conachta. When he and his colleague Loeg meet a beautiful woman named Skar in an inn, they do not suspect that she is a spy, and will kidnap Loeg to the secret city of Dun Darach (the 'Oak Fort' in Celtic). Cuchulainn will not stand for this, and sets off to Dun Darach to rescue him. This will involve secondary quests being completed along the way.

The game system is identical to that of Tir Na Nog – a single road of the city is shown at a time, which can be walked along to the left or right. When you come to a junction, the view can be rotated by 90 degree to allow this path to be followed. Gameplay is also similar - sword fights must be won and word-based puzzles solved, although unlike Tir Na Nog you cannot die.

Trade and money management plays a bigger part than before - objects can be offered to, sold to and stolen from others, and you get obtain jobs for money. Watch out for Ryde the policeman - if he finds you with stolen goods, everything you are carrying will be taken. You must also speak to people and enter magic rooms to obtain key information.

The game is split into three parts, played through the eyes of a different character each time. In the first you are the Werewolf's host, and must beat the curse back. Sex is added to ultra-violence in part 2; you play the woman who loves him, and must survive a night of passion. In part 3 you play the host again, and must reach Fi Shan monastery to find the cure.

		<name>Benny Hill's Madcap Chase!</name>
		<desc>The late comic's risque TV show usually saw him dashing around frantically chasing after scantily-clad ladies half his age and half his weight. Colour-clashing bras would lack beauty, however, so the licensed game instead sees Benny attempting to carry out 3 levels of work for the community (he was a nice guy at heart). Unfortunately, his generosity is misconstrued as theft, so you'll have to flee as quickly as possible.

On level 1 he is taking laundry from the clothesline to the laundry basket, item by item, avoiding the local busybody, on level 2 he gathers apples whilst being chased by a tractor, and on level 3 he collects bric-a-brac, much to the police's panic.

The graphics are large and blocky, using a similar style to Don Priestley's Popeye license for DK'Tronics. The gameplay takes place on 3 depths of each side-view flick-screen, with obstacles such as lamp-posts often blocking one of those levels, requiring a quick move into the screen. Contact with these obstacles costs time, which is vital when you're being chased to your target.

There are 5 difficulty levels - the latter ones increase the volume and pace of the enemy, and add more mountains to avoid.

		<name>Sentinel</name>
		<desc>The gateway to your galaxy is guarded by five space stations forming the Sentinel system.
Your galaxy is under continuous threat of attack, but the enemy can only attack during the short periods of relative calm in the asteroid storms. During such  periods, the enemy must destroy Sentinel before the main battle fleet can enter your system.
Your task is to delay the enemy by protecting the Sentinel system for as long as possible. It is as simple or as difficult as that!!
For this purpose, each station has four space ships for defence and you can use one at a time. The ships are armed with a photoncannon and guided missiles. The guided missile is controlled using the same rotation keys used for the ship (the ship is immovable at this time) and may be exploded by pressing “thrust” (space key), or if a missile hits an object or after flying a certain distance.
The station's radar discs flash to indicate the approach of enemy bombers.</desc>

Your character has plenty of attacking kicks and punches to use on anyone who gets in his way, starting with the local banker, and then some coyotes roaming the plains, who are easier dodged than killed. After this, you find yourself atop the train, attacking a succession of guards in one-on-one beat ‘em up duels, each of which must be won outright within the time limit to avoid losing a life. Many of these shoot at you, so dodge their shots as you attack them. The game offers a practice mode, in which you have 32 lives to try to improve your skills, and a ‘normal’ mode in which you have unlimited continues as long as you can reach the high-score table with each continue – in this mode, as in the ‘advanced’ mode in which you must always start again from scratch, you have 5 lives

		<desc>Skate or Die incorporates five distinct styles of skating, which can be attempted individually or in turn. You skate around a menu room to choose which one to attempt. Before taking off you can visit Rodney's skate shop to buy equipment.

The first event is freestyle, in which your aim is to score as many points as possible in 10 attempts. Judges determine how much style and skill you have shown. The High Jump uses the same equipment, only this time your task is to jump as high as possible at the end of the ramp.

The downhill events are overhead-view races. In the Downhill Race you simply try to complete the course within 90 seconds. In the Downhill Jam you try to outperform a human or computer opponent whilst dodging or jumping hazards. You can use attacking moves to either remove hazards or knock your opponent over. 

The pool joust is more of a one-on-one beat em up using a stick, set within a pit to skate around.

But, as was habitual in his experiments, he had failed in his objective and now a gang of uncontrolled hens is circulating around the city putting eggs on the street.  But certain special eggs have the capacity to turn one person into a hen (or at least that's what they believed) if the egg crushes on his head.

Is the sequel of the first game dedicated to the famous Ibañez's comicbook saga, "Mortadelo y Filemón", known as "Clever &amp; Smart" or "Flip &amp; Flop" outside Spain.

The journey is largely from left to right, although downward movements through gaps and upward movements on rotating platforms are also frequent. Some drops can be fatal, but mostly those which have a platform in close reach, so these are avoidable and not purely random. There are many magic teleports en route, and the high trees narrow the journey. Extra lives (via collecting 8 crystals) and improved weaponry are on offer throughout your quest.

This means zapping through six constantly-scrolling and diverse levels of minions including balls, ships and spinning dice. The level designs are such that many sections of barriers and force fields need to be shot before you get to them. Lots of immovable blockades and blind tunnels are in place, so the route is extremely mazy. Bonus tokens can be picked up in a sequence which grows in value progressively, so be careful to pick up the earlier ones and keep the sequence going.

		<name>Action Reflex</name>
		<desc>Action Reflex involves steering a bouncy ball through 75 screens of hazards. These include lakes, drains, daggers, and a network of pipes which can send you back several screens. You play against a time limit, and contact with one of these hazards deducts time from your limited amount (there are no 'lives' to worry about), and puts you back at the start of the screen. 

Movement is controlled by moving left and right at increasing speed, and using the fire button to jump vertically. Once the all is aerial, it can be vaulted over hazards through careful steering - the faster the ball is going, the higher it can go, and the longer it takes to bring it back under control - the ball can bounce quite far before being stoppable.

As you play through the game, points bonuses can be collected, which ultimately place useful objects into your possession - keys, hammers and rings, which can be used via an icon system.

		<name>Glider Rider</name>
		<desc>The World Government has taken the decision to wipe out the Abraxas Corporation, a weaponry-dealing regime that has helped dictators and terrorists for decades. As a member of the elite Silent But Deadly force, you have been sent in to destroy their plastic island, most importantly their 10 reactors. The twist is that you are expected to do this on board a rickety hang-glider.

Everything on the island must be bombed using your grenades, but the most efficient method of travel is to hug the ground and stay low, so a balance must be found to be in the sky at the right times. Each reactor is protected by lasers, although by running into the nearest control tower these can be sent haywire for long enough to allow you to jump in and destroy them.

		<desc>Whilst trying to reach the haunted mansion in which your kidnapped lady is held, your car runs out of fuel. As a result, you must progress on foot to reach her.

The areas you must travel through include the forest, cinema, a ghetto and the graveyard. All are filled with ghouls, zombies, ghosts or bats, all ready to drain your energy. To complete each screen you must collect the five blue crosses. Once you reach the mansion and find her, you must escort your girlfriend back through the same territories, switching between characters to collect the blue (him) and red (her) crosses as quickly as you can, still not safe.

		<name>Frightmare</name>
		<desc>This is a platform-game, where you play as a man who's experiencing a horrible nightmare. And if you die in it, you die for real...

Your mission is to survive long enough to wake up. For every room you visit, another 6 minutes goes by, and at 8:12 the alarm clock will ring, and save your life.

Your secondary objective is to increase your dream-state. You start with a "bad dream", but by killing monsters, and collecting chalices, you can get much worse dreams, like "horrible dream" or "deadly vision". Your dream-state is displayed in text-form at the top of the screen, and does not affect the game in any other way.

This is a horror game, and you will face zombies, bats, ghosts, and other terrifying creatures. If they touch you, you lose one of your five lives. You can collect different items, like guns, crucifixes, clocks, and other stuff. Your inventory can hold up to three items at once.

You can kill some enemies with the gun, but many are immune to it. Crucifixes can freeze enemies, and clocks slows them down.

The game consists of a huge maze of interconnected rooms. It's easy to get lost, and the game is almost impossible to complete, even if you cheat. So this is for anyone who wants a big challenge.

Bertie The Bee loves ripe and sweet fruits and when he sees it, he must have it. No matter what. He flies to a fruity place where a big spider has build his web. Doesn't Bertie know or doesn't he just care?

You control Bertie across the screen and must collect pieces of fruit. When you've eaten a piece of fruit it will be replaced by a portion of the spider's web and when you get tangled in it you'll die and the spider comes down to grab and eat you.

There are ten levels of difficulty ranging from 0 to 9. When the easiest difficulty level is selected the web of the spider is not visible at the start of a game. The higher difficulty level you select the more visible will the spiders web be.

Each stage starts with 2 bikes to shoot out, although planes and tanks also appear on the horizon, to be shot for bonus points. You start with 3 bikes and an infinite supply of bullets, with one bike lost every time you crash.

The levels are tree-lined, and at top speed it can be terrifying as you try to muscle through the gaps so as not to lose distance on the target bike. Every second level is played out at night, which changes the colour scheme.

		<desc>Cyrus T. Gross has built the TALOS asteroid and directed it towards earth. Only the Nemesis Organisation's Mobile Attack Droid 471 can save humanity now. 

In N.O.M.A.D., players take control of the Mobile Attack Droid 471 as it ventures through the city, in this top-view shooter. Players begin with four lives. The Droid moves with considerable inertia (although some rooms disable this), and control involves using left and right to rotate it, pushing forward to provide thrust in the direction it is facing, and pushing backwards to reverse. 

The early part of the route is linear, but later on there are junctions to plan around. Moving enemies, spawning points and wall-mounted guns are the main threats. There are many switches along the walls, which open the sealed doors located throughout the levels, although a switch doesn't automatically operate on the nearest door. The game features regular checkpoints, which will restore the droid to that point after the lose a life. Points are awarded constantly for survival, and for shooting the enemies and other targets.

While the five different screens are similar, each one is unique in its way: In the third screen, you first see eggs flying around before the birds hatch and start unloading on you. And in the fifth screen, you have to destroy the enemy mothership.

These screens are viewed from the side, and resemble Jet Set Willy, except that Wilf can fly through them and hover at a precision point. With hazards ranging from dinosaurs to spears to spaceships, and pieces located in hard-to-reach places, you will need this extra skill, especially as you have no weaponry. Most screens have more than 2 exits, but some are dead ends or lead directly into hazardous points. On each world you can immediately access the first 3 screens.

His mission is to destroy the Tyrant Beast, an evil ruler of the dark and dangerous world in which Frognum lives. The main weapon in the game is fire breath, but on his quest Frognum will find many magical artifacts and, thanks to those, gain new powers. 

The gameplay is simple. The player just has to explore different screens, incinerate opponents and use artifacts (for example Morph Helix that transforms Frognum into a sea monster, which allows him to swim and fight underwater).

		<name>Smash TV</name>
		<desc>The year is 1999. The world's most popular television show is Smash T.V., an ultra-violent contest between two armed-to-the-teeth combatants, set loose in a series of deadly arenas that are filled to bursting with hordes of mindless beasts and killer robots. The aim of the game is to blast everything in sight and try to grab more cash and prizes than the other guy. Toaster ovens, VCRs, fancy cars and luxury holidays are there for the taking... for anyone who can survive long enough to enjoy them.

Smash T.V. is an insane shoot-em-up from the brain of Eugene Jarvis, creator of Robotron: 2084. It retains that game's frantic style of play and two-joystick control method, but adds plenty of gore, violence, a hint of satire and that all-important two player mode.

		<name>Star Wars - Return of the Jedi</name>
		<desc>The arcade game from Atari based on the third Star Wars movie features three action sequences inspired by the film. 

First, you control Princess Leia on a speeder bike racing through the forests on Endor. You have to evade trees and deal with enemy troopers by shooting at them or luring them into Ewok traps.

In the second sequence, you control Chewbacca who has captured an Imperial AT-ST Walker, evading tree traps and shooting at enemy walkers. In this sequence, the perspective sometimes switches to the Millennium Falcon which you must guide through a fleet of enemy Star Destroyers and TIE Fighters.

In the final sequence, the Millennium Falcon enters the Death Star and has to make its way to the reactor, surviving more TIE Fighters and laser turrets. Once the reactor is destroyed, you have to get out again before the explosion engulfs the ship.

After the Death Star has been destroyed, the game restarts at the first sequence, but with a higher difficulty.

A more accurate title for the game would be 'Tintin Gets to the Moon', as reaching it is your challenge. The game is split into two distinct types of sections; the first of these involves guiding the rocket through space. Steer it to avoid contact with asteroids, and to collect eight red spheres. Yellow spheres boost energy, and so should be collected.

This is followed by a platform-based battle, as the evil Captain Jurgen has tied up several crew members, planted time bombs, and started several fires. Use your extinguisher on Jurgen and the fires, and touch the bombs and crew members to solve those problems. Turn gravity off to reach the more troublesome bombs.

The player must battle through 8 top-view stages packed with obstacles, within a time limit - any remaining time is converted into points. Contact with obstacles (including trees, bicycles and a chasing car) causes damage to accumulate; once this reaches maximum the game is over. 

Before the game starts you can upgrade your car; with £2000 to spend you must choose one (or none) of each of the four categories - tyres, fuel, boost, and handling upgrades such as power-steering and improved brakes. Through trial-and-error you will learn which combinations suit your driving style and the ensuing hazards the most. Further upgrades can be collected on the odd-numbered stages, by driving over them.

If you take too long to complete a round, a fireball will strike one of the tiles on the board, causing them to collapse and making it more likely that you or your opponents are killed. In some rounds, you can get power-ups that give you extra bumping powers and the ability to jump over gaps. When you jump, you can break a tile to the point where it collapses, making it easier for opponents to fall down the gap that will be left there.

		<name>Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde</name>
		<desc>Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde is a text adventure based on the famous novel by R. L. Stevenson. In this game you play the roll of Dr. Jekyll / Mr. Hyde. The year is 1868 and you are close to the completion of your work into the human psyche. The game starts in your drawing room the night before Dr. Jekyll creates the potion that will transform him into Mr. Hyde.

The Spectrum version of the game is divided into three parts (Dichotomies, Duality and Denouement) while the Atari version is just one long game. The goal of the first part is to mix up the portion that will transform you into Mr. Hyde. In part two Mr Hyde starts dominating over Dr. Jekyll and in the last part it is time to get rid of Mr. Hyde once and for all.

The Spectrum version was created using Professional Adventure Writer and the Atari version using STAC.

There are three levels of play and each scene within those levels presents Rupert with a different number of problems. In the third level Rupert will find warm clothes scattered around the Ice Castle, which will help him keep warm as he searches for his friends. The character can run, jump, duck to avoid snowballs and slide along ice patches.</desc>

		<name>Meganova - The Weapon</name>
		<desc>Hi, my name is Philip Sunset, but my friends call me "long hands" and my office is one of the best remunerated of the galaxy, I am an illegal appropriator of objects that I do not own, although there are people who vulgarly call it "thief". And this time I am involved in a very undesirable situation. The thing is that I took the Sprocket System "landed", apparently one of the most secret treasures of the Drowhar army. But, as usual, these boys are not very happy and have decided to convert me into cosmic phosphate, something that wouldn't be so easy for them. I was contracted as a pilot by the Terra-1 confederation interstellar forces, although it wouldn't be bad at all if you could help me...

		<name>Thrust II</name>
		<desc>The physics-based gameplay of the original Thrust is back and the controls of your craft are basically the same - swivel left and right, and thrust. While the essence of the game remains very similar there are some differences second time round. 

The Federal Resistance has captured an artificial planet of great strategic importance in the war against the Galactic Empire. However, the purification of the planet's atmosphere is not yet complete.

You must search the planet for 16 orbs, the majority of which lie below the surface, these are required for the construction of an atmospheric processor. This will involve descending into the maze-like tunnels of the planet, avoiding (or destroying) a variety of androids in your path and returning to the surface with the orbs in tow. 

Only one orb can be picked up at a time and they must be put in place at a designated site on the surface. Once an orb is picked up a timer begins counting down; if it's not in place in time the entire planet is destroyed! If your craft (or an orb that has been picked up) collides with the walls or the androids that patrol the passageways then it is instantly destroyed, a shield (life) is lost and play is resumed from a nearby location. Weapon pickups destroy all enemies on the screen of a specific type but can only be used for a limited time. 

Instead of the individual levels in the original game, there is only one game world in Thrust II and the orbs are scattered about in different places; they are also of varying masses and affect the handling of your craft differently.

In this game Baron Von Bankjob has escaped from jail and it is up to Hong Kong Phooey to find him. The game starts off with the trademark scene of Hong Kong Phooey jumping out of his file cabinet as seen on the animated TV show. From there on you must maneuver yourself through each of the levels full of obstacles like the Baron's thugs, collapsing platforms, conveyor belts, oil and acid patches. Hong Kong Phooeys health is displayed via the "Hong Kong Phooey Book of Kung Fu" meter located on the bottom left of the screen. Collect drinks to help replenish your health, unlock doors and activate switches to help advance further into the level to find Baron Von Bankjob and bring him to justice.

During the rounds you must jump over rocks and fire as well as shoot helicopters as they will make you crash and lose time.

You have a set amount of fuel and you must collect fuel canisters to replenish it and maintain your speed. Should your fuel count reach zero you will go slow until you collect a canister which would also cost you time. You also cannot fire with your fuel empty. If you complete all eight rounds the game loops over and you begin at round one again. If you fail to complete any round within the time limit, your game is over.</desc>

		<desc>This was one of the Spectrum’s earliest Pac-Man-influenced games, taking place on a quick succession of small levels. The level designs have a lot of complex corridors and side-lines, as well as at least one wrap-around section and one tunnel – the ghosts may well be waiting for you at the end of this. Each level features one power-pill to put to use, and an increasing number of enemies as you progress. Unlike most games of the style, after collecting all the dots you must progress through an exit at the right of the screen, so it might be worth planning your path through the dots so as to finish near this.

The game engine is menu-driven, using the joystick to select options from menus to activate each of the game's main functions. The screen display has both top down and side-view representations of what is going on around you, plus measures of your mind and body health, and an inventory.

To help, Thelric teaches you four spells - a magic missile to attack creatures, a burn spell which works over a wide radius, a spell to drain enemy energy, and a magical shield. Additional weapons (including daggers and a mace) and potions can be collected throughout your quest.

		<name>Ramparts</name>
		<desc>Not to be confused with Atari Games' Rampart, Ramparts is in fact a clone of Bally Midways' Rampage, but with a medieval theme, and players are giant knights instead of monsters. The game is for one or two players simultaneously, and each has the opportunity to enter in a five-character name before play begins, which will subsequently be displayed next to individual scores during play. 

The game takes place on a single screen, where the player(s) can move left and right on one foreground plane, and the object is to destroy a castle, each phase, by scaling and punching the individual buildings until each, and all collapses. Buildings will often overlap, requiring some to be taken down before others. Players will be harassed by witches, goblins, archers and the like. 

The back story concerns two knights, Sir Griswold and Sir Larkin, who have had a curse set upon them to be transformed into giants by the Evil One, and they must quest for the fiend, so that they may be restored to mere mortals.

The game was pitched somewhere in between a full-blown simulation like F1 GP and action games like Continental Circus. Only 12 cars were in each race, which could last from between 3 and 20 laps.

Before each race you can customize wing downforce, gear ratio, tyre selection and fuel load choices – pitstops are a standard feature of the longer races. The 16-bit versions include a unique 'Improve With Mansell' mode, in which a digitized version of Nigel's head appears in the top corner of the screen, offering instructions and praise.

		<desc>Set during the collapse of the Soviet Union, this arcade style game puts the player in control of a Soviet tank. This tank must explore the areas of Vilnius and Baku and rescue all Russian citizens. Meanwhile, the rebel armies will attack with everything they have.

The game uses an overhead view of the battlefield and multi-directional scroll. The gameplay is reminiscent of games like SWIV, but the need to rescue a certain number of hostages to complete the level adds a limited strategy element: the goal of the game is not to defeat the enemies, a task literally impossible as they re-spawn within seconds, but to rescue the hostages before being blown up.

An alien race is threatening the galaxy. It is up to the Rebelstar Raiders to infiltrate the aliens' home base on the planet Thray 6. They have to get in, steal some alien eggs for research purposes, then get out - fast. There is only a limited time until the rescue ship must leave the planet, and the Raiders had better be on board.

Rebelstar II features a dangerous scenario on a hostile world. Slash through jungles, wade through deadly swamps and enter the alien base, where the Queen sits, guarding her eggs.

		<desc>Buffalo Bill presents a collection of six Wild West themed mini-games, which hang together around humour-lead presentation and backdrops.You can play as many or as few of these as you like, and can always have another go at them if you fail.

First task is to throw knives at a spinning board upon which a surely-terrified and fortunately-skinny lady is locked  - make sure to adjust for the rotation that will occur in the time your shot takes to hit. You get points for missing as many times as possible before hitting. Event 2 is based on shooting ability and is in two stages. First you must shoot the targets of criminals (but not innocents) as they emerge from the ground, next you must shoot the bottles they throw at you from over the horizon.

Event 3 is Calf Roping, in which you must position yourself so as to be able to throw your rope around the poor cow's neck. This is followed by Bronco Riding, in which you must adjust your balance to compensate for the Bronco trying to throw you off, by pushing the joystick out to balance two bars. Level 5 starts off like the Cow Roping, as you jump onto a Steer, before a joystick-waggling section starts. Last of all is a side-scrolling game in which you jump onto a stagecoach which has been invaded by Indians, and beat up the hijacker.

		<desc>This interactive fiction title (one of three licensed Masters of the Universe titles released in the mid 1980s) might suit the more intellectual He-Man fans. Skeletor has developed an Earthquaker device, which uses hypnotic rays to control a horde of Rockbinders -  gigantic boulder beasts capable of gnawing through solid rock. As the game starts, the beasts are tunnelling beneath the Shadowlands and approaching Eternia. As Adam AKA He-Man, can you stop Skeletor and his evil plan before it is too late?

The game is reasonably easy by adventure standards, and uses a largely two-word parser with commands such as ENLIST, EXAMINE and FIT. Time saving commands include GET ALL and DROP ALL, and BOM (back one move) for undoing mistakes.

You explore the streets and houses in the search of a way out. The main basis of the game involves picking up objects and using them in the correct way - most objects have more than one potential use, and misusing them is the only way the game can be lost. There are several sub-games along the way, including shoot 'em ups, a maze and a jigsaw puzzle.

		<name>Hunchback</name>
		<desc>Victor Hugo never could have expected that his creation Quasimodo, the Hunchback of Notre Dame, would run such an obstacle course as is dished up in this game, dodging fireballs and arrows while leaping over pits and pikemen, sometimes with the help of a swinging bell-pull rope, in hopes of rescuing his beloved Esmeralda from the top tower -- all while being slow-but-steady chased across the castle parapets by an invincible knight in full armour.  Once you get the hang of any individual obstacle, the game starts throwing them at you in tandem, until toward the end you're tracking the swing of the rope, the thrust of the lance, the approach of the arrow and the advance of the knight all simultaneously!  Succeed, against all odds, and you get to do it again, but faster!  Even an able-bodied protagonist would have a hard time juggling all these threats, but I have a feeling a dedicated player with patience and good timing can overcome them.  Let's call it a hunch.

		<path>./Rebelstar - 1 Player (Europe).tzx</path>
		<name>Rebel Star - 1 Player</name>
		<desc>A turn-based, tactical squad combat game for one or two players, from the creator of the later X-COM series.

Moonbase Delta may look like an unassuming mining colony, but in fact, it is the secret location of the ISAAC super-computer, used by the Empire to break the Rebels' secret codes. The Rebelstar Raiders' mission is to break in, get past the patrolling robot guards and destroy the computer. It won't be easy.

Your Raiders each have a specific number of action points per move, which can be allocated to movement, firing and object manipulation. Keys, medical kits and repair droids are among the available objects. Shots can be precise, point-blank (less points used, but less prospect of success), wide-range, or opportunist.

		<name>Los Inhumanos</name>
		<desc>"Los lnhumanos" is a game in which our objective will be to rescue the girl who has been kidnapped by another enemy group called "Los Rokopiedras". Besides capturing our beloved, they have also committed an excess which is what really did upset Zufuru, the inhuman protagonist of this history: they have destroyed his dear Simca 1000, a unique car, full of memories of our friend.

And, as this history occurs in the city of the skyscrapers, the distant New York, Zufuru will have to cross the famous Central Park in order to find the resting four pieces of his little car. Only when all of them would be on his possession he will be able to accede to the Empire State, the second level of the game and where his beloved is located.

For the most curious, this game debts its name to a Spanish pop music group which had quite succes during the eighties, period in which they produced some of the most danced songs on the Spanish youthful and universitary circles, that's also why you can listen to some of their most famous songs during the game, as well as seeing their mascot on the game.

		<name>Fernandez Must Die</name>
		<desc>Fernandez is a despot who has invaded the Republic of El Diablo, bringing terror to the local people. The rightful leaders of the country have called you in to destroy Fernandez's hideouts and bring his country back to the people.

Fundamentally this is a Commando clone, scrolling vertically and with hordes of enemies to be taken on, with finding good shielding spots and launching surprise attacks an especially useful strategy.You have unlimited bullets and limited but collectible grenades to use. There are landmines to avoid, and medical packs to pick up.

On each of the 8 levels you must destroy Fernandez's buildings, which are accessed through an underground network of tunnels. You're not limited to being on foot - you start off in a jeep and can also use motorbikes, tanks and similar, although losing a life destroys this. In 2-player mode you can split driving and gunning duties. When starting a new game, you always start from the point at which you died in the last game.

		<path>./Raid over Moscow (Europe).z80</path>
		<name>Raid over Moscow</name>
		<desc>The USSR has launched a huge attack on the USA, and the only hope for the free world is for you (as leader of a US Squadron of fighters) to destroy their defense bases. This is done in a multi-stage action game with some similarities to the same developer's Beach Head. All the mini-games must be completed before the time limit on the bomb is expired.

The first thing you will see is a missile being launched; the game then takes you to your hangar, from which you must quickly launch as many ships as possible, a task made difficult by the limited gravity. You must then fly it into Soviet airspace in a side-view shoot 'em up section, in which staying low keeps you safe from radars, and quick reactions see you shoot enemy fighters and avoid trees.

The next scene takes place on a single-screen view, with five windows to shoot through, and enemies aiming at you to be avoided. You then reach the base, and must shoot out approaching enemies. Finally, you must use discs onto a wall, such that they rebound to hit maintenance robots, with the ultimate goal of causing the base to overheat, the Soviet attack to be thwarted, and the US to be saved.

They're seeking items (gyroscope, fuel canister, key card) and then seeking to leave via a rocket-ship before a blizzard sets in. New trap items include a saw (for cutting holes in ice), a plunger detonator (with dynamite), an ice pick and snowshoes. There are some pitfalls (thin ice and snow drifts). Hand-to-hand combat is done with snowballs. Watch your spy's body heat or he'll become a permanent resident.</desc>

To do this he will have to find three envelopes, which are located in three distinct sections of gameplay. The first is platform-based, involving jumping across rocky ledges to pick up objects and bring them back to the main computer at the start of the level. Part two puts you at the wheel of a car, picking up energy pills and using a (limited) shield to fend off attackers. The third part is a maze of sorts, and after this is completed you must make your way back to the computer through the caves again.

		<desc>Gauntlet, the original arcade smash hit, is a fighting game where you choose a character and let rip into the hordes of enemies that assault you on you way to the end of the level. One or two players must make their way through 100 levels of mayhem and magic. 

It featured a choice of four characters to play with, each with different weapons. Thor the Warrior, has a  bludgeoning battle axe, Thyra the Valkyrie, has a close range sword, Questor the Elf has his long range bow, and Merlin the Wizard has magical bolts.

Ghosts, goblins and even the life draining Death are your enemies. Enemies stream out of generators, so destroy these before tackling the rest. 

Keys are needed to open the many doors within the levels, and in some situations a door will contain only bonus items, not a progressive route.  Scattered magic potions act like smart bombs and clear the screen of all enemies. Beware of poison though, this reduces your energy level.
Treasure is abundant throughout the levels and adds to your score.

Each of these involves a two-man squad, whom you can switch between at any time. Each must select the correct objects to bring beforehand. You will have to move through the screens via lifts and ladders, avoid hazards and solve puzzles.

Mission one is set in a mine shaft, which is rapidly flooding and has two miners trapped. Next up is a nuclear submarine stranded after hitting a mine, which must be repaired and reactivated before it explodes. During this mission, you discover evidence of the miner's construction, so must break into a bank to steal the appropriate documents. This reveals that a madman is holding International Rescue to ransom, so you must finally travel to his lair to stop him.

		<name>FA Cup Football</name>
		<desc>F.A. Cup Football is officially licensed by the English F.A, and lets you lead your English club side to the FA Cup victory. First you have to select your team and how many players will play the game (maximum is 8). You can select formation and between 3 different game strategies, which are: attacking, balanced and defensive. Sometimes you have to answer to some questions where you have 3 choices. For example, if your player wants to leave the club, what would you do?

Like in the real F.A Cup, your opponent will be decided by a random draw. Before each match you will see your next opponent. In the game you'll see all the fixtures, and watch how the matches are going minute by minute. If your team wins, you continue to the next round (unless it was the final). Drawn matches result in replays; at this time infinite replays were used rather than penalty shoot outs. Random events such as player injuries or off-pitch problems often occur before replays.

The major corporation there, Omni Consumer Products (OCP) saw an opportunity to sell a new kind of law enforcement officer to the troubled city. They took what was left of Murphy, encased it in titanium armor, wiped his memory and created RoboCop. Now it's up to RoboCop to clean the streets of Detroit and eliminate the one responsible for his murder, Clarence Boddicker. But it looks like Clarence might not be the kingpin of this town...

Based on the 1987 movie of the same name, RoboCop allows the player to control RoboCop. The majority of the game is a side scroller. RoboCop can punch unarmed citizens and shoot armed citizens. He can move left, right and duck but can not jump. Different weapons can be picked up from enemies, and power-ups to restore health and/or energy. Following levels, RoboCop will have to match a criminal's face to the proper mugshot and engage in a first-person shooting bonus round.

		<desc>Mega Phoenix brings the concept of the earlier arcade game Phoenix into the 90s, to the extent that a coin-op version was later made by Gaelco. The game is a single-screen shoot ‘em up in which the player moves left to right while shooting several waves. There is a shield function available, which lasts for a short period of time (after which it must recharge to be used again) and it paralyses the craft while active.

The first waves consist of several small alien beings in a set pattern, which move down from the fleet towards the player at random intervals- contacts with these kills the player. Deadly phoenixes firing at you come next, followed by the Mega Phoenix itself and then a final boss, before it all repeats with higher difficulty.

		<name>Samurai Warrior - The Battles of Usaji Yojimbo</name>
		<desc>With the Roger Rabbit film (and game) successful, and the Jive Bunny phenomenon shaking up charts worldwide, perhaps it was time to redress the balance away from wimpy rabbits. Stan Sakai's comic character set in the 17th century did this, being capable of a range of martial arts moves. In this licensed game he'll need them to save Japan from being taken over by evil.

The game is side-scrolling and has large beat 'em up elements, but also incorporates Karma. Negative actions such as needless violence will be punished with a loss of Karma, while positives ones (such as bribing those who give Karma) are rewarded. When in combat, energy gauges display the condition of both yourself and your rival. Money collected can be spent on food for energy boosts.

		<desc>Competitors in this ITV television game show had to show their prowess on a range of vehicles including Buggys, Speedboats, Quad Bikes, Jetskis and Inflatables. Players of this licensed version must do the same, on horizontally and vertically scrolling levels on land and water. Many levels include enemy droids as well as inbuilt hazards, all of which must be avoided. The main unique event is The Hill, an assault course which takes place on foot.

Up to three human players can take turns to contest the various events. The exact sequence of events is randomized each time, which makes the loading from cassette potentially slow and frustrating

		<desc>Kong's Revenge is an action game based on Donkey Kong. It is divided into two parts.

In the first part, the player must climb to the top of five buildings and must defeat one of Kong's minions on each one. Throughout the level, the player must avoid barrels and fire balls, and activate levers to move platforms. 

The second part, which can only be accessed when the first one is completed, is a simple side-scrolling run 'n' gun game. While still avoiding barrels and other objects, the player must shoot at enemies. Finally, they have to defeat Kong and save the girl.

March through the rivers, swamps and forests to overthrow the dictator (specified as Batista in Japan) in this evolution of the Commando style.

The game scrolls vertically, as you move up the screen shooting enemies, finding good strategic firing points and collecting powerups. As the enemy soldiers come towards you in groups, some care is required when picking them off, either using your gun or the grenades. There are also hostages carried by some soldiers, with points bonuses for not shooting these but shooting their captors. Each level ends with a boss.

Enemies moving around on preset paths include spiders, tanks and lobsters. 

Once all parts are connected Frank must activate the switch on the monster's case. This takes you onto a screen in which you must reach the top right, avoiding the balls the monster throws down at you as they roll along the platforms.

		<desc>There are four fairly distinct sections to this Wild West themed action game, two involving shooting and two putting you on horseback.

The first level involves shooting at birds, with a minimum of 3 required to progress. You must aim in front of the birds, so as to allow for the distance they will cover as the bullet travels. In the third level you are now shooting at bad guys, who emerge from locations (bank, saloon, store) on an accurate Wild West layout.

The second level sees you attempting to jump over rocks and cacti, whereas level 4 involves jumping across a speeding train in order to wrestle control of it.

		<path>./Park Patrol (Europe).tzx</path>
		<name>Park Patrol</name>
		<desc>Do you have what it takes to become a park ranger? This game will test you to see if you're really up to the job. You play a park ranger, whose job is to collect twelve items scattered around the park, such as soda cans, bottles, and balls. Unfortunately, getting these items is not as easy as it sounds, as your task gets difficult by swimmers, swamps, snakes, turtles, and ants. To make matters worse, your energy gets depleted quickly, so to restore it, you can either return to your hut, or snatch food off an ant's back in later levels. More often than not, some of the turtles will follow you into the lake. If they enter the lake, you can run them over for 500 points before they decide to jump back out again.

Besides collecting items, you also must rescue swimmers that are about to drown in the lake. Fail to rescue a swimmer in a limited amount of time, and you'll also drown, and the same can be said if you bump into snakes. Rather than collecting items, you  can also roll on logs. Doing this will earn you 5000 points if you manage to roll for a long time. There are five levels of Park Patrol to complete, and once you complete all of them, the diffculty level gets higher and the game becomes much more difficult. To give you an example, the turtles will stop at nothing to kill you, and there will be more than one swimmer to rescue at once.

This game can have two players. Park Patrol even provides you with a menu, in which you can alter the number of turtles, ants, swamps, swimmers, and snakes in each of the five levels. With the menu, you can have none of these in every level, but what's the fun of completing a level without any enemies to avoid? Also, you can play as a boy or a girl.

		<desc>The original Kick Off was expanded on in many ways for this sequel. The game now features full tournament modes (although the players on the teams are fictitious) and four different pitches (including an implementation of plastic pitches, whose uneven bounce cause controversy when several British clubs tried them in the 1980s).

Viewed top-down, the controls involve trapping the ball under your foot, giving you time to prepare passes. Running with the ball is tricky at first, as it doesn't stick to your foot the way it did in contemporary football games. Complex moves such as overhead kicks, back-heels and long-range through-ball passes can be completed with practice.

The main thing making life harder is that the level is always scrolling in random directions, and contact with the wall at the edge of the screen costs you a life. As a result, careful planning is required to ensure that you don't get trapped into a corner. There are seven levels of increasing difficulty to get through.

		<desc>Jetman has crash-landed on a distant planet, with ledges suspended in mid-air and populated by various nasties, and he must escape and find his way home. Your first task is to retrieve each of the three parts of his spaceship, in order, and carry them over the base part. After this, you must collect enough fuel to be able to fly away, again by picking it up and dropping it over the ship (you don't have to actually make contact with the ship in doing this). Once you've filled the ship up, you can fly on to the next level, in which you must again refuel.

Each level contains various bad guys, with different attack patterns; you have a lazer to shoot them for points, and must avoid contact with them. Diamonds can be collected for bonus points, and you get an extra life after every 10,000 points.

		<name>Freddy Hardest</name>
		<desc>The most irreverent playboy of all the galaxy, heir of a great fortune, has a totally irresponsible life, given to uncontrolled drunks, endless celebrations and excesses of all kind. After one of his last "little" parties he decided to take the controls of his spaceship in not very appropriated conditions to pilot, so our sidereal playboy went to play with meteorites under the effects of drunkenness. Evidently this diversion could not have finished very well, he crashed with a meteorite, lost the control of his spaceship and fell with it to planet Ternat's moon, where it's located the enemy base of Kaldar. Injured and laughing, he managed to left the smoky spaceship and slowly noticed that in such a place he wouldn't be received in a very friendly way. Already recovered of his dunk, Freddy Hardest, who although could not look it, is one of the most intelligent members of the Sidereal Free Planet Confederation's SPEA Agency Service of Counterespionage, he must start the adventure.

		<name>Hotshot</name>
		<desc>A simple two-player game released to much marketing fanfare, Hotshot places you and another player (either another person or an AI robot) in an arena split down the middle into two save for a hole about half the screen's height for the ball to travel through, with a series of bricks on each side to destroy.

The aim of the game is to destroy your own bricks before your opponent can destroy his. This is achieved by catching the small by pointing your suction device at it and holding fire, and then releasing in the needed by letting go of the button. This is easier said than done, as the ball neither moves in a straight line or according to the natural rules of.gravity.

Should either player be hit with the ball and not catch it properly, they will be knocked down and possession of the ball is passed to the other player.

		<name>The Ninja Warriors</name>
		<desc>Two player side scrolling beat-em-up converted from the Taito coin-op that featured three monitor screens side by side. The Amiga version was developed in letterbox format in order to show as much of the wide screen background graphics as possible. 

The player(s) controlled robot Ninjas, which battled their way through the levels using Shuriken and knives. As the Ninja's took damage their classic Ninja garb was torn away to reveal robotic limbs, torso or head. When the damage reached critical the Ninja Robot would explode, scattering mechanical body parts.

As with The Sales Curve's later title SWIV, The Ninja Warriors used the company's Dynamic Loading System to load sprites, sound and background graphics from disk on the fly.

On the first operation you will have to travel to the Morania desert in order to reduce a dangerous group of Arab terrorists who have met in an abandoned town. On the second one, you will have to destroy a military base located in Tirania, where an invasion of the neighboring countries is being prepared. In order to carry out so difficult missions you count with a modern N-16 A2 rifle gunner with telescope sight, 2 shippers of 50 bullets each one and 2 long-reach pumps, although in the course of the combat you will be able to acquire more ammunition. Sometimes you will see dynamite charges deposited in the ground; an accurate firing on them will end with every object or person on the screen. Also you will be able to shoot to boats, which will provide you an extra dose of energy.

You start with a small amount of money, which is used to buy goal cards; each of these sets you up a chance in a match. Up to three can be played in each game, making Hat-Tricks a possibility.

The action sequences involve studying a move plan on the chalkboard, then getting into the right position to execute the final shot. Fail to score enough goals and you may lose your place in the team; do especially well and you may gain a transfer up the league.

The specific objects required to clear each plug must be obtained, in many cases by shooting the enemies who hold them - a task made harder by the fact that contact with them is fatal, you start without weaponry, and no weapon has unlimited ammunition. Whirlpools and bubbles must be used to reach the various areas of the Deathbowl. Contact with water causes Sweevo to start rusting, although oil can be picked up to limit the effect. The game is viewed isometrically, and features over 200 screens of action and puzzles (more in 128K mode).

		<name>Shadow of the Beast</name>
		<desc>While very young, Aarbron was kidnapped and enslaved by the Priests of the Beast Lord. He grew up on drugs made to destroy his own will and turn him into the Beast Messenger, a powerful creature serving Maletoth, The Beast Lord himself. He did his job, until one day he noticed a man about to be sacrificed in a ritual, his face triggering ancient memories... and as the sacrificial knife descended into the man's body, Aarbron recognizes the face. Of his father.
As his father dies in the altar, memories of his childhood and tormented past at the hands of the Beast Lord emerged, and as feelings of hate over his captors took over him, he swore revenge and fled the temple, knowing the road to avenge his father and redemption would be hard.

Shadow of the Beast, one of Psygnosis most popular titles during the 16-bit computer era is a side-scrolling platformer best known for the use of parallax scrolling along lush graphics, a musical score  by David Whittaker, a iconic cover by Roger Dean and what many consider to be unforgiving gameplay, balancing between the "very challenging" and the "impossible". The player has to navigate through several areas filled with enemies and traps, collecting keys and activating triggers than open new areas or give Aarbron the means to overcome a sub-boss. The number of moves the player has at disposal is limited: duck, jump and only two attacks: punch and a flying kick. While most enemies die with just one hit, the player must time each attack accurately. However, there are also traps of objects that cannot be destroyed, and these require the player to jump, duck or move according the sequence. The player has only one life with 12 hit points that can be replenished by collecting some objects hidden in the level (like an off-route location or a under a megalith), which also contributes to the difficulty level.

As you play and get winning combinations, you'll have to choose whether to collect or gamble what you've won. After completing the fruit machine game, you'll get the chance to play a dice game where you have to guess if the next throw will be higher or lower than the current one. 

Dizzy Dice features two game modes. The first one you play as a normal fruit machine. But then there also is the bank mode, where you start with $20 and need to reach $100 to break the first bank. In total there is five banks, each requiring more cash to win. The game is controlled using the keyboard.

		<path>./Snooker (Artic Computing) (Europe).tzx</path>
		<name>Snooker</name>
		<desc>The game of snooker was surging in popularity in the early 80s, and this was one of the first interpretations of the sport for the Spectrum (at least three others called simply 'Snooker' exist). Shot direction is achieved by rotating a line which comes off the cue ball, which can be steered in either direction at slow or fast speed, and the shot's pace is set by pressing a letter key, allowing for 26 different shot strengths, A being the lightest and Z the hardest. As well as playing full matches, you can set up practice shots by moving the cue-ball.

The game uses a slightly simplified version of the game's rules,
with only 9 reds, and therefore the maximum possible score is only 99, rather than 147 in a full game. The touching ball and free ball rules aren't featured, which make it possible to cheat, either exploiting the former absence by playing 'push shots', or the latter by rolling into a colour to play an impossible snooker, immediately getting the foul points back and probably leaving yourself a good position.

		<name>Ms. Pac-Man</name>
		<desc>In 1982, a sequel to the  incredibly popular Pac-Man was introduced in the form of his girlfriend, Ms. Pac-Man.  This sequel continued on the "eat the dots/avoid the ghosts" gameplay of the original game, but added new features to keep the title fresh.

Like her boyfriend, Ms. Pac-Man attempts to clear four various and challenging mazes filled with dots and ever-moving bouncing fruit  while avoiding Inky, Blinky, Pinky and Sue, each with their own personalities and tactics.  One touch from any of these ghosts means a loss of life for Ms. Pac-Man.

Ms. Pac-Man can turn the tables on her pursuers by eating one of the four Energizers located within the maze. During this time, the ghosts turn blue, and Ms. Pac-Man can eat them for bonus points (ranging from 200, 400, 800 and 1600, progressively). The Energizer power only lasts for a limited amount of time, as the ghost's eyes float back to their center box, and regenerate to chase after Ms. Pac-Man again.

Survive a few rounds of gameplay, and the player will be treated to humorous intermissions showing the growing romantic relationship between Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man, leading all the way up to the arrival of "Junior".

His orders are to simply capture photographic evidence of the war crimes taking place, but after finding a close friend tied up, he decides to wipe them all out by himself. This being Hollywood, chances are that he will succeed.

Ocean's interpretation of his challenge recreates Commando fairly closely. You move up the screen, taking out enemies – these respawn, so there is no value in not moving upwards as quickly as possible. Find strategic positions from which to attack. Touch each hostage you find to free them.

You have knives and grenades, but using the latter alerts the enemy as to your presence, making life harder. Extra weapons such as rocket launchers and machine guns can be collected en route.

There are eight levels. When the last level has been completed the game cycles to level one again and continues with no increase in difficulty.
You get an extra life if you clear 4 waves. They keep on coming and the object is to get a high score.

Interesting key mapping on this game:  the bottom row of keys moves left &amp; right, but they are mapped alternately so Z, C, B, M and SPACE move you right while CAP SHIFT, X, V, N, and  SYMBOL SHIFT move you left. The middle row of keys (A, S, D, etc) power the thrusters while the top row (Q, W, E, etc) fire the dual lasers

		<desc>From Konami's coin-op, Ping Pong recreates the fast-paced sport of table tennis. To win each match you must get to 10 points with a 2 point lead - if the scores reach 10-9 the game goes on until someone has a 2 point lead or reaches 15, in a similar manner to tennis. There are nine skill levels to beat, with increasing abilities as the game goes on. The human player has the advantage of serving first, and as the serve reverses every five points, you are guaranteed to have more chances to serve than your opponent (remember the significance of 10 and 15 in the scoring). The points system rewards long rallies and large winning margins, as you get points for each hit, for each point won, and for each point of the winning margin.

		<name>Biggles - The Secret Weapon</name>
		<desc>WE Johns’ tales of a brave World War 1 pilot were updated for a 1980s feature film, with a plot involving Jim, Biggles’ brother who lives in that era. Jim travels back through time to warn Biggles of a spectacular weapon the Germans have created, with the intention of changing history – for the worse.

The game is split into two separate games, and the first of these is itself split into three sub-games. The first of these is a side-view flight game, in which you must shoot down and dodge Fokkers who come at you from the right of the screen in your rickety plane, with a machine gun and bombs on board. Part two is set in modern-day London, and the characters must jump across a network of roofs in order to obtain a secret code. There are guards to avoid, and big gaps between roofs to avoid. The third part is a side-view game inspired by Green Beret, with a gun to fire at encroaching enemies, gameplay on multiple vertical levels, and grenades to collect. Lose a life in any of these and you will cycle back through them.

The second game is a more serious flight simulation however. A helicopter is beamed back in time for our intrepid hero to use. You must first go to the Allied camp to get the secret weapon’s location (and you will need the password from part one of the game for this), and then head to that location to destroy it and save the world.

		<name>Cybernoid - The Fighting Machine</name>
		<desc>There are three asteroids, hidden among thousands, where various minerals and precious gems were stored. It was believed the riches would be safe there, until the Zoggians discovered them! Now you have to fly an experimental spacefighter, the Cybernoid, into battle to recover the asteroids. The Cybernoid is equipped with standard laser blasters, missiles, and the ability to pick up other weapons along the way. 

Cybernoid is an arcade style action game for one player. You can choose from three different skill levels; easy, hard and lethal. On some versions two different sound modes are also available, a basic music and sound effects mode, and a super sound effects mode with no music. Each room you explore is equipped with a time bomb. The bomb will explode taking you with it should you take too long to get past all the obstacles on the screen. You start the game with nine ships, and more can be earned by collecting enough points during the game.

		<desc>The arcade follow-up to Yie Ar Kung Fu switches from the one-on-one style into a platform beat 'em up design. You play Lee, who has become trapped in the Temple by the Triads, and must escape by over-powering them. Each section of the game is on several levels (which you can jump up and down) and scrolls. Balls of energy are sometimes released when you kill a Triad - grab this and it becomes a powerful weapon you can hurl at an opponent. Most enemies can be killed with standard kicks, but each level has a Super Triad who can only be killed through magic.

		<desc>The late martial arts hero features in this platform game, with the aim of reaching a wizard in an underground lair, defeat of whom can offer him untold wealth. 

In each area you must collect the many strategically-placed lanterns before exiting through the newly-revealed passageway. Some rooms also have escalator-type sections to run along, and the standard (although slightly illogical in this context) ladders. 

On the way, you'll fight two enemies - a ninja and a green sumo warrior named Yamo. You can defeat them by punching, kicking, dropping on their heads or luring them into hazardous terrain, or even by making them accidentally hit each other. Even after they are killed, however, they keep coming back for more after a few seconds. Since they can move pretty intelligently (they even climb ladders), you should watch out for them. 

There are lots of hazards to avoid by either walking round or jumping - walls of electrical charge and exploding bushes for example.

The platform puzzle which first introduced Luigi to the world has both single and multiplayer action with two differing game types, but with the same objective.
Crabs, turtles and fighter flies must be cleared out by jumping underneath the platform they sit on, then kicking them away. Each level is cleared when a set number of coins is collected.

For the two player mode, the first to collect the set amount of coins wins.

The game is a crosshair shooter influenced by Operation Wolf. The viewpoint is from slightly behind Harrington, while the game scrolls on as you clear each section. Mouse control is offered on 16-bit versions. Your armour must be kept functional by collecting top-ups, and there are weapon power-ups such as machine guns and rocket launchers to be had. You can't go in all-guns-blazing however, as killing a single innocent causes Harrington to lose his job

		<name>Ninja Master</name>
		<desc>Ninja Master combines four small sub games into one. 

You are a trainee ninja. You want to impress your peers and become a true ninja. The time for the annual games has come around and you must compete and succeed at these games to achieve your goal. The games consist of four tests:

Test 1: The arrow test
Arrows fly at you from off-screen, both right and left, high, middle and low. You mist stop them hitting you by punching or kicking the arrow, so not only do you have to hit the right key, you have to do it at just the right time.

Test 2: Breaking a block of wood
Two keys are designated 'Right power' and 'Left power'. You must hit these alternately to build up as much power as you can within a time limit. With enough power the wood breaks and the crowd cheers.

Test 3: The Shuriken star test
Similar to the arrow test, stars fly at you from off-screen and must be blocked by hitting the right key at the right time. However the starts travel faster and, 'coz you're using your ninja sword and not your fist &amp; feet, you have greater range so there's less time to react.

Test 4: The blow dart test
Here you must use a blow-gun to hit targets

In all tests there is a qualifying score and you have three attempts to beat that score.
Succeed and you progress on to the next test.
Fail and it's back to the beginning.

Avoid the bulls and sharks, take care to avoid heatstroke, and make sure your family doesn't run off.

Getting there and simply surviving all the hazards the brochure 'forgot' to mention is a challenge in itself, but you must also take 10 holiday snaps to prove what you got up to.

The game is structured similarly to a real holiday. There are day trips to go on, which provide extra photo opportunities. A few Spanish phrases such as 'QUE QUIRE USTED' ('what do you want?') and 'UNA
HABITACION' ('a room') are included; the manual details these. The parser is primarily VERB NOUN.

		<desc>Dustin’s life of crime has caught up with him; he’s been incarcerated in the high-security WADRAS prison. In this arcade adventure, it is your job to get him out, within three hours. Getting into fight with guards, or spending too long in the restricted areas to the north, incurs a twenty-minute penalty and returns you to the opening room.

The task involves avoiding guards and manipulating valuable objects. The prison is split into three horizontal corridors, each with many rooms containing prisoners. The player can often trade objects with these prisoners, or simply beat them up instead. Once outside you can escape into safety, by crossing a ditch and then navigating a harsh rural area. The game is viewed from a forced perspective, which takes on a 3D effect while outdoors in the open.

		<desc>Sai Combat features real-life combat, in the Japanese style of Sai Karate AKA Kendo. The difference from standard karate is the presence of a large stick for each player, which is used to inflict much of the damage. Your challenge in a one-player game is to progress through the Belts and Dans, by winning every fight. Each hit scores you points depending on how tough a maneuver it is deemed to be- three hits must be impacted to move up a level. A player's energy level, or Chi, is depicted by a white dragon turning green or red as weakened.

This allows him to take control of Castle Grayskull, kidnap the Sorceress, and create a horde of fighters to attack He-Man's palace. He-Man must first rescue Orko from an 'imprison' spell (by collecting the right ingredients to cast a counter-spell), before taking on the full horror of the defences Skeletor has placed around the Ilearth stone.

He Man must use the Sword of Power to destroy the foes he faces throughout his journey, which is horizontally-scrolling. He-Man has a limited amount of time to complete his task, and a limited Body Shield to protect him for combat harm.

There are 16 stages set across the US, gradually moving from east to west, all depicted differently visually. After every 4 levels, you go into a shop screen, with a choice of upgrades. As the title implies, you now have a turbo booster installed, which speeds up the car, although over-use can cause the engine to overheat, and it is not recharged until each shop section. You have 5 continues, and failure to complete the course within the time limit costs you one.

Getting out would be the trick. Each room is inhabited by monsters that must be neutralized and the exit itself hidden underneath bricks.

The first of the Bomberman series. Bomberman is a single player game with a top down view and simplistic controls. In fact, in addition to movement, you only have a single ability: placing bombs. Each bomb explodes into a cross-shaped blast (4 directions) which can destroy either enemies or blocks. Power-ups may be found to increase the size of the blast, place additional bombs, increase the speed of the Bomberman or to walk through walls. Your goal on each level is to destroy all enemies and escape through the exit before the time limit is up.. Hitting the exit with a bomb blast releases more enemies which must also be destroyed.

Gemini Wing is a vertically-scrolling shoot 'em up, which is distinguished by its unusual power-up system. Instead of gaining occasional tokens which lead to lasting weaponry improvements, occasional flurries of tokens are released to ensure a quick burst of improved fire. The organic backgrounds are detailed, and have many sections which fire at you.

		<name>Quazatron</name>
		<desc>Quazatron started life as Steve Turner's port of Commodore 64 shoot 'em up Paradroid , by his longtime partner Andy Braybrook, but during the design process he decided to change the view to an isometric one, as this would suit the system more. Knowledge of Paradroid is an advantage (not least because it's a splendid game), as most aspects of the game overlap, including the plot, which sets you as the renegade robot KLP-2, armed with experimental technology to attack enemy droids. 

Your task is to deactivate robots, which can be done in a number of ways - shooting them, gaining control of them so as to deactivate them (known as 'grappling') or pushing them off their circuits. Knowing which method to use in each situation can only come from practice. Grappling is done from a separate screen, and involves aiming at the enemy droid's 12 sectors so as to turn at least 7 of them to your colour. When this is done successfully you can harvest some of the droid's components for your own use - a clear grappling victory gives you more chance of these elements being undamaged and usable.

		<path>./Platoon (Europe).tzx</path>
		<name>Platoon</name>
		<desc>The film Platoon featured a squad of five soldiers on their mission for the US Army in Vietnam. In this action game based around the film, you take control of these five guys in turn, with the chance to switch between them as they each take one of the 3 hits that would kill them.

The game recreates each of the sections of the film, starting with a side-scrolling journey through the jungle, with paths to cross both horizontally and vertically, and the ability to jump or duck hazards. You will need to blow up a bridge and then locate a village, which contains a torch, a map and a trap-door. The enemy has booby-trapped the area and are launching airstrikes, so the danger is not all from enemy ground soldiers.

The next section is in first-person 3D, as you move through a network of tunnels in search of flares and a compass. There are 3 distinct control methods, changing from the standard motion when an enemy appears (this puts you in control of a cross-hair for more accurate targeting), and when you enter a room to search.

After escaping this you settle in a bunker overnight, and have a limited amount of flares with which to locate incoming enemy, and must then shoot them before they can shoot you. The jungle airstrike from the film is the next moment - you have two minutes to rush into a safe position to the north, using your compass for guidance.

Finally you face the treacherous Sergeant Barnes, and must hit him with grenades 5 times whilst trapped in a foxhole to prevent him wiping you out.

		<name>Nick Faldo Plays the Open</name>
		<desc>Nick Faldo Plays The Open is a golfing game for one player. The object is to complete a round of golf in as few strokes as possible.

Game features :

1. based on a real course the Royal St. George's golf course of Sandwich, England,
2. keyboard of joystick control,
3. definable keys,
4. options to play either a full round, play out (holes 1 - 9), play in (holes 10-18), or play any individual hole.

Game play :
The game screen is divided horizontally into two parts. Initially the top half of the screen is used to display the game setup menus, control method, keyboard key definition, etc. Once this has been completed the top half of the screen displays the map of the course and the bottom half of the screen is used to set up each stroke. The map in the top half of the screen can be toggled between a large or small scale view to enable the player to line up their shot.

The lower half of the screen consists of seven 'windows'. Two of these are information and show wind speed,and course information such as length and par for the current hole, strokes taken for this hole and for the match so far. A third toggles between a large and a small scale map of the course, three more set up the stroke and the last plays the stroke.
To make a stroke the player first moves the cursor to the club selection box where they can cycle through the available clubs :- putter, driver, wedge, 3 and 5 woods, a 3, 5, 7 and 9 irons.

The player then sets both the strength and direction of the shot before moving the cursor to the central box where a little animation plays, the caddy hands over the appropriate club and the shot is played. As the stroke is being played it is possible to fine-tune the shot and adjust the direction and strength.

Once the ball has been struck in the lower part of the screen, the upper part of the screen shows a top down view of the ball travelling over the course. When the ball has come to rest the player repeats the cycle until the ball is in the hole. The process is repeated until the game is complete

		<desc>Fox is a member of the special corps CEO, and his next assignment is in the Soviet city of Chernovska. The last CEO member who was sent there went missing after sending a report on a new military project called RAM.

R.A.M. is a side-scrolling action platformer where the player takes control of Fox. When the game begins Fox has landed far away from his objective and he needs to cross several areas packed with enemy soldiers. At first, Fox has to rely on his assault rifle and his hand grenades, but later on he can use stationary guns and even vehicles. The vehicles need fuel, and their clever use is essential in succeeding.

		<path>./Skate Crazy (Europe).tzx</path>
		<name>Skate Crazy</name>
		<desc>Pull on your skates and get down to the local car park where your prowess on eight wheels is put to the test in the 'Car Park Challenge'. 

The player grooves his way around one level of the car park which has been turned into a multidirectionally scrolling arena for the gladiators of roller racing. Kick cans over, litter to collect and obstacles to avoid in the shape of cones, ramps, sand, bouncing balls, flying frisbees, mazes of tyres and rocks, and even other skaters. Finishing each level is a battle against time to negotiate a series of gates in a set order, the next gate being signified by a row of dots which flash between its flags. 

To complete rounds successfully, though, suitably impressive stunts and tricks are carried out to appease a set of four judges. Each have a card which they periodically display at the bottom of the screen, notifying the player of his progress. When the player's energetic jumping skills have gained enough points to qualify, he skates through the finishing gate and has his performance rated. Failing to qualify forces the player to skate around the car park against the clock, picking up a set number of pieces of litter. Beating a level allows the player to skate to the level's exit ramp, from where he chooses to move up to the next level or leave the car park and move onto the next part of the game, 'The Skate Crazy Championship Course'. 

This section of the game is a race against time over four horizontally scrolling cityscapes of platforms and ramps, with the player building up speed on his skates using a paced joystick waggling movement. Ground level obstacles and gaps in the floor are crossed with leaps of controllable strength and items at head height are avoided by judicious ducking. Birds and other creatures also spell doom for the heroic skater, unless he is able to avoid them or throw things at them. 

Points are scored in this section by picking up extra skating paraphernalia, such as pads, clothes, skates and litter.

		<name>Bobby Bearing</name>
		<desc>Bobby Bearing is a young steel ball who lives in the land Technofear, carefully avoiding the dangerous Metaplanes. One day his evil cousin comes along and lures him and his four brothers directly into said Metaplanes and leaves them for good. So Bobby's quest of the day is to find his way home and rescue his brothers.

The Metaplanes are a big maze of isometric screens without scrolling. The main challenge is to find orientation in this maze with various dead ends and junctions; there are also lifts, magnets, air ducts and hidden switches to complicate matters. There are also enemies and traps to avoid, e.g. evil marbles, crushing blocks of stone or hard to navigate places with opportunities to fall off the screen.

When Bobby finds one of his brothers, Bobby has to roll him to the exit. There are no lives or energy bars to be found in this game: it simply has to be completed before time runs out. Dying or getting stunned by an enemy results in a time penalty. Similarly the player can easily restart a screen with a time penalty if he has manoeuvred himself into an unwinnable situation.</desc>

		<desc>You are supposed to take your girlfriend to the Live Aid rock concert tonight; unfortunately, thieves have stolen and dismantled your motorcycle. You realise this at 3pm, and must find and reassemble all the parts in order to arrive at your girl's home by 7.30pm. Fail, and she will go with the loathsome John instead.

The game is a time-limited adventure, in which you must walk through the mean city streets, by directing the player sprite into, out of and across the screen. When you meet people you are told of their physique and job, and can interrogate them about your bike (resulting in set dialogues), run away, or fight. This results in a one-on-one beat 'em up element, with punches, kicks and a headbutt available. Your strength is represented by a glass of beer going from full to empty - when it's empty you are dead. There is a bar in which to recharge your energy (the dangers of riding a motorcycle after drinking alcohol have not been incorporated into this logic).

The game plays out on a 3D landscape with hills and valleys made up of several levels. At the highest vantage point stands The Sentinel, a statue-like being with an energy draining stare, you begin at the lowest. "Energy" plays an important role, there's a constant amount in the game world and each object is worth a certain number of units - including you.

The object of each level is to absorb The Sentinel and Hyperspace to the next from his vantage point.</desc>

They are not the kind of people anyone would allow to run freely through the streets.

Once inside the camp, the first action will consist in cornering the four captains, to snatch each of their codified cards. Simultaneously, it's necessary to find two security computers: one opens the door of the subterranean base and the other allows access to the control room. Finally, you should arrive at this room and activate the missiles with the cards. You will then need to leave the base.

		<desc>Renegade 3 was the third and last in the Imagine's series, based on the original coin-op by Taito. The hero's girlfriend has been beamed into the future, while the man himself has been sent back into prehistory. This sets the scene for a sideways scrolling arena combat game, where the player fights in various time periods. The settings varied from Egyptian and medieval, to a futuristic level. As such, gone are the attacks of street gangs from the first two iterations of the series, replaced by assailants such as knights in armor and robots. In each level you have six minutes to reach the finish, as this is all the time the time-travel portal is available for. There are many surface hazards to avoid, as well as multi-layered Green Beret-style areas. You can kick and punch at different heights, allowing you to deal with each of the diverse foes.

They had completed one of the most difficult computer games ever devised; GYRON NECROPOLIS, and were brought together to compete in the grand final play off. Their task? Complete the GYRON ARENA game in the shortest possible time. The prize? A brand new Porsche 924 motor car or £12,500 cash. Further competitions were held in Spain and Denmark simultaneously with London to give foreign finalists the chance to claim the prize. The winner came from the Spanish heat, who finished the game in a blistering 18 minutes! Here is your opportunity to play the ARENA game used in the final ... Bet you can't beat 18 minutes!"

The action is viewed from the side, with the graphics drawn in vectors, in keeping with the mathematical nature of everything that unfolds.

As a Resistance fighter, the player must fly into enemy lines in order to steal Klystron Pods to power more advanced starships, using your tractor beam to take them. A network of mounted guns are aiming to shoot the player down – these can be disabled by shooting their power source, but eventually this will explode, forcing the player to flee. Some of the later levels feature reverse gravity, which is where things really get difficult.

In order to do this, though, you need to collect the door pieces that are scattered in the six dungeons that await you, and defeat the black wizard in the end. Time is against you, so you need to hurry up. Once you have collected all pieces, the exit door will open, and you can proceed to the next dungeons. Collect other items for bonus points and avoid other knights that will shoot at you, even when their backs are turned. To make it fair, you can shoot them. Some knights only take one hit to kill, others may take more.

		<name>P47 Thunderbolt</name>
		<desc>The P-47 was one of the toughest planes in use in World War 2, and this side-scrolling shoot 'em up puts you in control of one as you take on hordes of Nazis. 16-bit versions have a simultaneous 2-player mode, as well as the ability to wrap-around the game with increased difficulty up to 4 times.

You are initially armed with a machine gun, but can also pick up bombs, spray missiles and multi-missiles by picking up the appropriate letter. Each weapon can be upgraded by picking up further tokens of the same type. Tokens offering extra lives and speed-ups are also on offer.

		<path>./Nemesis the Warlock (Europe).tzx</path>
		<name>Nemesis the Warlock</name>
		<desc>2000AD hero Nemesis must defeat the evil Torquemada, the Grand Master of Termight, and the hordes of Terminators he has dispatched. The game is set on a succession of 30 single-screen levels comprising of networks of platforms. You are armed with a gun (with limited ammunition) and a sword, and must kill a set amount of Terminators on each level. Terminators follow a set pattern, so you can work out which ledges they will reach next. Dead Terminators remain on the screen - when you are not doing well, Torquemata can sometimes turn these into vicious scythe-wielding zombies.

		<path>./Ant Attack (Europe).tzx</path>
		<name>Ant Attack</name>
		<desc>nnUm jogo isométrico inicial que antecede o clássico Knight Lore do Ultimate por um ano. Usou o que chamou de algoritmo "softsolid 3d" para representar uma grande cidade de rolagem a partir de uma perspectiva isométrica comutável. A cidade, identificada no quadro como "Antescher", uma combinação de Ant e Escher, o famoso artista paradoxo visual, está repleta de formigas gigantes mortais. O jogador controla um menino ou uma menina e corre ao redor da cidade, tentando encontrar sua metade perdida, enquanto pulando em estruturas para evitar as formigas, ou lutando contra os insetos, saltando sobre eles ou jogando granadas.nnnnAnt Attack, como a maioria dos jogos do seu tempo, foi criado quase exclusivamente por um único programador, que também projetou os gráficos e o som. Este jogo teve um apelo visual único em um tempo antes que as aventuras de ação isométrica se tornassem a última moda.</desc>

		<path>./Titanic Blinky (Europe).tzx</path>
		<name>Titanic Blinky</name>
		<desc>Arthur J. Hackensack, an insane Texas billionaire bent on conquering the world, kidnaps professor Frobisher Goonhilly, a paranormal scientist working on a matter transformation weapon. As a demonstration of its powers, Arthur transforms the Isle of White into a giant custard slice, New York into a bath sponge and the Eiffel Tower into a toast rack. The ghost Blinky, secret agent for S.P.E.C.T.R.E. (Society for the Prevention of Ectoplasmic Crime, Telekinetic misuse and Reality Endangerment), infiltrates the madman's sea ship (the newly raised SS Titanic) armed with an ectoplasmic gun and a case full of disguises.

Titanic Blinky is a platform adventure and a clone of Dizzy, replacing the egg protagonist with a slightly effeminate ghost. As in that game, the aim is to collect objects (by pulling down on the movement controls) to solve puzzles. One main difference from Dizzy is the fact that Blinky carries a gun with infinite ammunition. There's an energy bar at the bottom of the screen that gets depleted every time Blinky touches an enemy. When it's empty, Blinky literally flips over and the player loses one life. The game starts with three lives, and there's no form of saving progress.

		<name>The Munsters</name>
		<desc>The characters from the 60s TV series The Munsters have been transported away to a mysterious castle. Playing as different members of the family in succession, the player must rescue them. As you walk through each room, you must collect items to help you deal with each challenge. You must build up your spell power by shooting ghouls, zombies and vampires, as this allows you to deal with other challenges. Avoid contact with those monsters, as they will zap your energy and finally kill you - you have a single life.
