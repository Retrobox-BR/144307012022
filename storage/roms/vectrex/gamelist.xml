		<desc>Mine Storm is the built-in game that came with every Vectrex unit. It was also released in a 3-D version that required the use of the Vectrex 3D Imager and Mine Storm 2 is a debugged version of Mine Storm.    One of the built-in versions of Mine Storm had a glitch that made the game crash at level 13, so GCE decided to send a copy of Mine Storm 2 to gamers that wrote to the company and complained.    This game is rare, because most of the gamers didn't know about the offer, and also because not many gamers got to level 13.</desc>

		<desc>You and other experienced intergalactic voyagers have heard about and shared the legend of Star Castle - a mysterious fortress in a far away galaxy filled with incredible riches and surrounded by revolving walls of shimmering solid gold. Yet no one, until now, has ever actually seen the Castle - or lived to tell about it!  As you approach, you are overwhelmed with the beauty of the Castle but you suddenly realize that the golden walls hide a deadly arsenal. To survive you must destroy the walls and the powerful Energy Cannon they shield. Perhaps you will be the first to survive the Star Castle's arsenal and prove the legend true. Perhaps not!</desc>
