		<desc>Named after the highest score possible in the game, 180 is an arcade darts game for 1 or 2 players that sees you control a disembodied hand as you aim your shot around the dartboard. The purpose of the game is to reach the 501 target before your opponent and take out the title of champion! The one player mode features a three round tournament against a variety of colourful opponents including Limp-Wrist Larry, Beer Belly Bill and Tactical Ted... although you'll have to hone your skills if you're to overcome Jammy Jim in the final!</desc>

		<desc>1st Division Manager is a football management game where you take on a team of your choice in any of the top four English leagues. On the main menu there are four icons as well as some major information such as your name, the name of your club, your current league position, a rating and the account balance. The first icon from left is the picture of a computer and by clicking on it you will get to the main database menu where you can handle the players training, studying the coming fixtures and edit the teams or players. The second icon is a telephone. Press it and you will be able to make a phone call to either the Transfer Market (for buying and selling players) or the the Bank (to get a loan). The third icon is a note book and by clicking on it you will see tables from all four divisions. The last icon is the picture of a football pitch and by pressing it you will get to your next match. After choosing your squad you will see the highlights of the match from a top-down perspective. After match you will get reports about players being injured, results in the other matches and the finances for that week.</desc>

		<name>2 Player Soccer Squad</name>
		<desc>Most football management games written for 64K/48K computers concentrated their memory space on providing as many features as possible for a lone player. As the title implies, this game is an exception - 2 players each take control of a club, taking it in turns to make their managerial decisions and play their matches. For an extra competitive edge, they can include their own name among the players (which are otherwise made up of the real players of the day). The game uses a fictional 20-team superleague, with English and Scottish clubs, as well as a knock-out cup. You can buy or sell players, who have ability ratings out of 15, and swap your squad of 19 around to choose 11 starters plus 2 substitutes. Match scores are listed along with goalscorers, although the scorers update more quickly than the scores. You are kept up to date with financial changes after each match.</desc>

		<name>3D Starstrike</name>
		<desc>The Outsiders have attacked the Earth Federation, laying waste to its defense fleets. In desperation, Federation Command sends the new Starstrike space fighters to attack the Outsiders's main bases (which are converted moons), hoping to exploit a fatal flaw in the design: a direct hit to the reactor at the center of the base might lead to its destruction. Both regarding graphics and gameplay, 3D Starstrike is essentially a clone of Atari's Star Wars. Using wireframe graphics with a first-person perspective, the player controls the Starstrike fighter in several distinct phases: the first phase is the approach to the enemy base, where Outsider space fighters must be destroyed. The second phase takes place close to the surface of the base, where enemy bunkers and laser towers await. The third phase is a trench run, where gun turrets await at the side of the trench, and catwalks blocking the way must be dogded. The run culminates in the reactor room, where two reactor pods must be hit to destroy the base. After a base is destroyed, the game continues with a new base in the next level, with later levels having a higher difficulty.</desc>

		<desc>As well as recreating off road racing, this game has considerable capability to upgrade your vehicle. There are four choices of vehicle on offer, each of which has its own weight/top-speed/build strength and so on, and thus is suited to different circuits. You can also buy upgrades and repairs, including carrying some spares. There are four completely different types of course, each taking place on a different surface - Mud, Ice, Desert and Mountains. Each of these is littered with hazards, which can either be painstakingly avoided, or driven through (with the resultant risk of damage).</desc>

Six British racetracks are featured, with 3-lap races. You must finish in the top 3 of the 8-bike field to qualify for the next one. You will often need to pit for fuel and tires during the race. The other bikes get quite a head start on you by being able to accelerate more quickly, but the first few are usually quite easy to pass on the first lap.</desc>

In all ten events you fly a BD5J Acrojet over a series of obstacles: 1. In the Pylon Race you have to fly around pylons and land safely. 2. In the Slalom Race you have to fly a 'figure 8'. 3. In the next event, the Ribbon Cut you have to break two ribbons. 4. In the Inverted Ribbon Cut you perform the same stunt but flying the plane upside down. 5. In the Ribbon Roll there are two ribbons in a row and you have to fly under one and complete a full roll followed by flying under the second ribbon. 6. In the Under Ribbon Race you perform a slalom by flying in sequence under three ribbons. 7. In the Under Ribbon Loop you fly under a ribbon followed by a loop and passing over the same ribbon upside down. 8. In the Spot Landing event you have to fly up to 2,000 feet and land on the runway as close as possible to a marked spot. 9. In the Flame-Out Landing event you perform the same stunt but then without the engines running. 10. The tenth and last event, the Cuban Eight, you have to make a half-loop over a ribbon, followed by a half-role, a half loop and flying under the first ribbon again. Some game parameters can be set. You can decide how the weather conditions are going to be. An instrument panel at the bottom of the screen contains several read-outs, like a altitude meter, a compass, an artificial horizon and a vertical velocity meter.</desc>

		<name>Action Fighter</name>
		<desc>This is a top down vertically scrolling shooter, in which you start off as a motorbike. You are quite vulnerable to attack at first, but power ups come in the form of a Sega van which you have to dock with. The first time you dock you get double fire, the second time gives you a rocket, the third gives a rear force field and the fourth invulnerablility. By destroying cars and bikes that appear on your way, you can collect A-F letters. Collecting A through to D allows you change into a sportscar which is less vulnerable to attack, but not as nimble. Collect all the letters in order to be able to transform into a high tech plane. This is the final stage of one of the five missions. Only the high tech plane can guide you to your destination in which your main target is hiding. There is also time limit in which you have to complete the mission. It is advisable to transform into the high tech plane as fast as it is possible. Picking up flags gives you bonus points with 10,000 points gaining you an extra life.</desc>

		<path>./Advanced Destroyer Simulator (France).zip</path>
		<name>Advanced Destroyer Simulator</name>
		<desc>Advanced Destroyer Simulator (ADS) is a naval combat simulation set in World War 2. It was the first naval simulation to use real-time filled 3D graphics. Its style and mechanics are reminiscent of Epyx's Destroyer (1986). ADS simulates the H.M.S. Onslaught, a British destroyer of the O-class fitted with three cannon turrets, four torpedo tubes on port and starboard respectively, and a sonar to detect and track submarines. In ADS, the Onslaught is not part of a flotilla. There's no campaign, gameplay is mission-based and set in three scenarios (two in the CPC version) with five mission each: The Mediterranean around Sicily, the English Channel between UK and France, and the North Sea coast of Norway. Objectives include seek-and-destroy assignments, patrols, convoy escorts, submarine hunts and blockade runs. Each scenario also offers an open Delta option where you cruise and hunt without specific objectives. You navigate the destroyer manually, in real-time and from a first person perspective, though with the help of a scenario map. ADS simulates ship combat as a close-quarter exchange of torpedoes and cannon fire. In proximity to enemy land bases, Stuka fighters can attack and must be shot down with the cannons. Submarines are tracked with the sonar and can only be attacked once they surface. Enemy vessels include freighters, tankers, torpedo boats, destroyers and cruisers. Most missions are time critical; in the course of the mission, it may be necessary to dock in allied ports for repairs, to refuel and restock on ammunition.</desc>

The essential theme of the table is of magic and wizardry, with the targets to be lit including the word 'MAGIC' as well as a weather potion and a magic cottage.

The only chance of survival is to reach the airdrop platform XV-238, located in the control base of the schizophrenic assassin professor McJerin, and to escape to outer colonies. There is no easy way to do this. The game is a side-scrolling shoot 'em up, with thugs coming at you constantly, and a few moves to use on them. You must cross the dangerous streets of Manhattan, which have become over-run by feral thieves. Later he awaits for the guardians of the scientific complex of McJerin.</desc>

This aircraft has two weapons: lock-on missiles and Vulcan cannons (basically machine guns). In some versions there is an option to let the cannons shoot automatically all the time. The game is viewed from behind the plane with you fighting wave after wave of enemy fighters. But at heart it offers the usual shooter mechanics, meaning you spend most of your time dodging and shooting. Sometimes you come across a friendly supply plane and if you dock with it you can replenish your missiles.</desc>

		<desc>In this action/simulation game by Microprose the player takes the role of an U.S. Army airborne ranger. These Airborne rangers are dropped behind enemy lines by parachute to perform all kinds of dangerous missions. Gameplay consists of 3 phases: Reading the mission briefing and outfitting 3 supply pods with machine gun ammo, time bombs, first-aid kits, grenades &amp; LAW rockets depending on this briefing. 2. Flying over the mission map in a V-22 Osprey plane to drop your 3 supply pods and parachuting out of the plane yourself. 3. Performing the actual missions and reaching the pick-up point before time runs out. There are 12 different missions which include capturing an enemy officer, blowing up an ammunition depot, photographing an experimental aircraft and liberating P.O.W.'s Missions take place in either an arctic, desert or temperate setting. Using the mission map the player must decide the route towards the mission objective. This might require them to crawl through trenches, run around minefields or take out enemy soldiers and bunkers. Airborne Ranger was one of the first games with some missions that required a stealthy approach (staying undetected until a certain time, taking out a guard and stealing an enemy uniform etc.). Airborne Ranger can be played in practice or veteran mode. In practice mode, gameplay is limited to a single mission, while in veteran mode, a series of missions or an entire campaign is played in order to earn medals &amp; promotions. All missions can be played on several difficulty levels.</desc>

		<name>Alien</name>
		<desc>"In space no-one can hear you scream." That tagline from the movie is apt for this strategy adaptation that follows the plotline of the first movie in the franchise. The action starts after the chestburster scene which unleashes an alien organism into their enclosed spaceship. The remaining crew members must attempt to destroy it while the traitorous android tries to protect the alien. There are 3 decks to search with 35 different rooms which are connected by ducts which the alien can use to sneak up on people. You can herd the alien into an airlock to blast it out into space, or set the auto-destruct on the ship and flee in the shuttle with all remaining live crew members plus Jones the cat who must be found and put in a box. The screen shows you a plan of the deck you are on, and the ducts in the immediate area. There are trackers and sensors which can be used to pinpoint movement in other areas. In ordering each crew member, you are given possible movements or other actions such as picking up weapons, entering the ducts or catching the cat. In certain situations, special options will appear such as starting the self-destruct system when in the command centre. The responses to orders are also affected by the personality of the crew member, and how much they have had to suffer. The screen also displays reports on the condition of the crew member youve selected, whether there is any damage to the room youre in and whether the duct grills are open (meaning the Alien has been through there). You also get the occasional message from the ship's computer Mother like when a crew member dies. Sound effects create suspense. At times you hear the alien move around or doors and grills being opened as well as the blip from the tracker.</desc>

You have to find 24 valves and the cryogenic chambers that they are to be plugged into before the ship reaches its destination. The ship contains many rooms filled with obstacles that you have to negotiate. There are several types of enemies such as Dalek-like mice and clockwork mice. Both should be avoided!

		<name>Alien Storm</name>
		<desc>The aliens are invading Earth, and it's up to the "Alien Busters" to wipe them out and destroy their creator. The Busters consist of Karla, Gordon, and Scooter. Each one of them have their own weapons and special attacks. When you start the game, you can select any one of these characters to play as. There are six missions to complete (eight in the Genesis version) with several stages, and each mission has you blasting aliens all the way to the end, from the streets to the mother ship where you'll meet the mother of all aliens. Unfortunately, blasting these aliens will not be an easy task, as they get tougher in every mission, and are capable of hiding into objects such as plants, postboxes, trashcans, drums, and several others. Each mission has an objective such as rescuing people destroying an UFO. When you deal with a few aliens, flying heads will appear, which you can shoot to collect life or energy (by the way, life is important to you, since if yours get empty, you're dead). However, rather than using your ordinary weapons, you can use the special attacks that are enough to kill aliens you currently see. These types of attack vary depending on the character you choose at the start of the game. For instance, Gordon summons a U.S. Air Force Jet that drop bombs across the street, while Scooter is able to teleport out of his present location, and leave a series of bombs that will blow up aliens on sight, he will then re-appear. However, using your character's special attack uses up a lot of energy, and if you have little or no energy, you can't use it. At the end of some missions is an alien boss, which you must destroy in order to complete the mission. Also, at the end of every one, you have to enter buildings where you participate in a shooting gallery. The object is to kill aliens popping up from several locations with the building. You can play Alien Storm by yourself, or with another person.</desc>

		<name>Aliens</name>
		<desc>Electric Dreams' game based on the 1986 film Aliens is a first-person strategy game somewhat similar to Space Hulk. The player controls six characters from a remote terminal, guiding them through a 255-room complex in search of the Alien Queen. Each character has a helmet camera and a smart gun, each controlled by the player acting in the role of overall operational commander. The player can switch to any character at any time, and must consider coordinating their movements and finding a safe location before switching to the next character. Characters occupy one room at a time, and can pan their view a full 360-degrees inside each room. Doors can be locked to halt Alien progress, or blasted open to get through (at the cost of permanently destroying the door). Alien bio-mass must also be destroyed before it spawns facehuggers, and the Aliens themselves leave lethal puddles of acid when killed (and so shouldn't be killed in front of doors!) Aliens prowl the complex and are attracted to gunfire. They will home in on nearby characters and attack, requiring the player to aim that character's gun to defend against the rushing Alien (a headshot kills instantly, while three to the body do the same). If an Alien attacks a character the player is not controlling, they will "capture" that character (indicated by a yellow status light). The player must guide another character to the position of the hostage and kill the guarding Alien to rescue them. If not, the captured character will be lost. Ammunition for all characters is limited, and refilled only by making a trip to the complex's armory. Similarly, a medical bay can replenish any damage. Characters also have limited stamina, used up with every move made. When stamina is low, the player must find a safe spot for that character to rest up. The complex also houses a generator controlling the lights, which the Aliens can destroy, or the Marines can then repair.</desc>

You are supplied with an Arachnus 4 ship and 5 million units of cash. There are 3 different types of ants - drones, queens and scouts, each representing their real function in the natural world, so queen bees are the most lethal opponents as they generate new ants. Money must be spend on buying improved weaponry (including that needed to destroy the Queen Bees) and repairing the ship throughout the 2500 screens Amaurote is depicted in. As your main weapons are bombs, you need to consider their bounce and distance before firing, to avoid being caught up in stray explosions yourself.</desc>

		<name>Anarchy</name>
		<desc>Inside an Ace Mk2 Interceptor tank, you have been assigned a hazardous 16-stage mission. You must travel to the overrun planet of Sentinel 4, and destroy the weapons caches the rebels have build up. They can't be blasted when you are right next to them, ensuring that a degree of planning and strategy is required. Viewed from above in levels with simple sideways scrolling, the objective on each level is to shoot each of the weapons crates, before going through the newly-opened exit. Guard droids must be avoided, but shooting them can leave them inactive for a short period of time, and they can now be shot or hit to push them in that direction, which can be used strategically to make more paths available. There is a 2-minute time limit on each level. Every 5th level has a nuclear weapon guarded by a seeking enemy droid, which continually follows you.</desc>

This game allows us to choose between an enormous number of options with the primary target to beat all our rivals. In the beginning of the game, you can choose between some game possibilities: joystick or keyboard, 1 player or 2 players, game mode, change your motorcycle characteristics, choose circuit, meteorology and load/save game. And then, in the World Championship you can choose another option: see the stats of your competitors (his times in the trainings, records and position in start line), also you can run the official training on each circuit to be placed on the best position to start the race. The game includes 16 circuits in total (the official of this competition), you can try it by separate to train, but if you want to win the title you must to show your abilities in each one of them since the first. Another caract of Pole 500 is the possibility to run in training mode or Championship mode with 2 players simultaneously (in this case the screen will be sectioned horizontally).</desc>

		<desc>Angleball is a variation on Pool, using a hexagonal table with 6 pockets and 6 sides. The ball can rebound off these at unusual angles, making the outcomes of shots harder to predict. The basic objective is to pot all the balls, while failing to pot a ball in 3 shots will lose you the frame unless your opponent also fails to do this. The game can be played by one or two players, with the one-player game consisting of a sequence of 20 different table layouts, each requiring its own style to win. Two-player games can take place on any of these layouts or one of your own design using the inbult table editor. Shot direction, speed and spin can be set on a general level.</desc>

		<path>./Annals Of Rome (Europe).zip</path>
		<name>Annals of Rome</name>
		<desc>Annals of Rome begins in 273BC and sets you as a Roman senator, with the ultimate aim of colonizing as much of the known world as possible, and retaining that power against Carthaginians, Vandals, Parthians, Persians and all the other world forces. You have a strong army at your disposal, and can direct your generals as to which countries they attempt to invade. The game is turn-based, and these turns operate in phases, beginning with the economic circumstances of population and tax income being decided - it's recommended to keep taxation taxing low unless things become desperate. The game then updates you on the statuses of your generals, and give you the chance to redistribute them to other parts of your kingdom. Officers may rebel and cause a civil war - fortunately this can usually be pre-empted. More serious are attempts to take land from other civilizations, which take place in order and include conflicts between other groups. These, like every element of the game, are accurately historically modeled and variable in time-span as a result.</desc>

		<name>Ant attack</name>
		<desc>The Walled City of Antescher has rested for a thousand, thousand years in the midst of the Great Desert inhabited by only the deadly Ants who have made it their home. The sands have piled up at the walls but for some reason have never encroached upon the city proper. The City rests dreaming of past glories, solid and unmoving; the signature of a long dead race. The City washed clean by the sun's rays. The city lost from the world of men for days without number. Then one day, one year, one hour, He arrived and She arrived, some say that they are descended from a race of wizards, some say that they are descended from a race hidden in a green valley at the North Pole. Who can really tell these days, how much do we really know about the world as it was, or as it is, after so long in the cold Dark Ages. Only Antescher seems to stand inviolate after all this time, teeming with secrets, yet silent. He and She arrived to play their games through the wind-swept streets, ousting the ants from their exclusive occupation. He and She are now wreaking havoc through the ants who for their part kill and kill again without thought or consideration, just carrying out a biological imperative. He and She run to and fro, climbing in and out the buildings, the sound of their feet stretching from block to block. They laugh and cry out in fear walking with each other just ahead of the Ants and Death. And above all the drama within it's walls the City of Antescher watches and watches waiting for the next renaissance and the next Golden Age. The City seems to have a presence, a huge brooding entity which hangs over the buildings and which in some mysterious way controls the destiny of those below...</desc>

		<path>./Archon (Europe).zip</path>
		<name>Archon : The Light and the Dark</name>
		<desc>Archon: The Light and the Dark is a strategic board game with some similarities to chess. Two sides, a light one and a dark one, consisting of 18 pieces each compete on a board divided into (9 by 9) squares. You win the game by having one of your units on each of the five powerpoint squares or by removing all opposing pieces from the board. However, you can't just remove a piece from the board by landing on it. When two pieces clash, the outcome is decided in the battle arena during one-on-one real-time combat (just like in Star Control, also by Paul Reiche III). If the real-time combat takes place on a dark square, the dark monster gets a health bonus (longer life bar). On a light square the light side gains an advantage. There are also some squares whose color changes over time (from afternoon, to dusk, to night, to dawn etc.), which adds an extra layer of strategy to the game. Unlike chess the two sides are not identical. Both sides consist of mythological creatures. For example the light side has among others unicorns, valkyries and a djinni while the dark side features basilisks, banshees and manticores. The differences are not just cosmetic. Two special pieces are the light wizard &amp; the dark sorceress, they can both cast magical spells like: imprison a unit on the board, shift the flow of time (change day/night cycle to your advantage), bring one unit back from the dead etc. The different pieces have their own movement restrictions regarding the number of squares they're allowed to travel on the board and whether or not they can jump over other units (like the knight in chess). Units also behave different in combat; some units are faster than others, some use melee attacks while others fire projectiles. Archon can be played with either one or two players. The NES version, which was released a few years after the other versions, has improved graphics for the real-time combat part. Each type of square has it's own colored background and the unit sprites are larger.</desc>

		<path>./Arkanoid (Europe).zip</path>
		<name>Arkanoid</name>
		<desc>The original Breakout concept involves controlling a bat at the bottom of the screen and using it to catch and direct a ball so as to hit all the bricks which are arranged at the top of the screen. It was unpopular for over a decade, before Taito revived it with some new ideas in this arcade game. The game's plot redefines the bat as a Vaus spaceship, the ball as an energy bolt, and the bricks form a mysterious wall stopping the ship from progressing to safety. By the mid-80s, power-ups were popular in most types of arcade games, and Arkanoid features them. They are caught by positioning the bat below them as they fall (meaning that you risk missing the ball if you go for them at the wrong time). The power-ups include lasers (which are mounted to each side of the ship and allow you to shoot out the blocks), a catching device (so as to be able to fire the ball off at a different angle every time you hit it) and one that slows the ball.... sorry, bolt.... down. Needless to say, the game inspired tonnes of clones, few of which added anything else.</desc>

		<name>Arkanoid : Revenge of Doh</name>
		<desc>Description The mysterious enemy known as DOH has returned to seek vengeance on the Vaus space vessel. The player must once again take control of the Vaus (paddle) and overcome many challenges in order to destroy DOH once and for all. Revenge of Doh sees the player battle through 34 rounds, taken from a grand total of 64. New features Gameplay as seen in the Arcade version of the game. Revenge of Doh differs from its predecessor with the introduction of "Warp Gates". Upon completion of a level or when the Break ("B") pill is caught, two gates appear at the bottom of the play area, on either side. The player can choose to go through either one of the gates - the choice will affect which version of the next level is provided. The fire-button is only used when the Laser Cannons ("L") or Catch ("C") pill is caught. The game also features new power-ups and enemy types, and two new features for bricks. Notched silver bricks, like normal silver bricks, take several hits to destroy. However, after a short period of time after destruction, they regenerate at full strength. These bricks do not need to be destroyed in order to complete a level. In addition, some bricks move left to right as long as their sides are not obstructed by other bricks. The US version features an entirely different layout for Level 1 that feature an entire line of notched bricks, with all colored bricks above it moving from side to side. Partway through the game, the player must defeat a giant brain as a mini-boss. After completing all 32 rounds, the player faces DOH in two forms as a final confrontation: its original, statue-like incarnation, then a creature with waving tentacles that break off and regenerate when struck. Home versions of Revenge of DOH also featured a level editor, where players could create their own levels or edit and replace existing levels, with the exception of two levels: the mini-boss and DOH.</desc>

		<desc>Army Moves is a one-player game which is divided into two parts. In part one, you drive a jeep and must avoid collision with other jeeps and being shot at by helicopters. Then, you fly around in a helicopter and the oject is to bring down airplanes without being shot at by the airplanes themselves, submarines, and any other ground fire. Make sure you land on the pad near the end. In part two, you start out in the jungle and must jump from rock to rock without crashing into toucans (shoot at them to make them fly higher) and being blown to bits. Then you have to make your way to the general's offices shooting soldiers on the way, and finally, locate the secret documents. When you complete the seven sections of Army Moves, you'll receive a higher bonus. Some versions have a high score table to record your achievements. The second section must be loaded seperately, using a code attained from completing part one, on some versions.</desc>

		<name>Arquimedes XXI</name>
		<desc>You just put a bomb deep in an enemy space station and now your goal is to successfully escape before the explosion. This should be the typical story of a nervous futuristic action game. However, here you are in front of your keyboard to play an adventure game. Surprising! Exploration and object research are the program to equip you to escape in a pod. Edited by Dinamic on Spectrum in 1987, ESP Soft offers us a CPC adaptation of a very successful game. It is easy to immerse in the oppressive atmosphere of the station. The vocabulary provided in the manual makes the game very accessible. The puzzles are logical and simple enough to solve. However, if the graphics are superb, we regret that they are not more numerous, the confined environment is a pretext for multiple reuse of the same screens. immersive musics add to the atmosphere. Quite short, providing no save option, ARQUIMEDES XXI is still a thrilling adventure. Accessible and available in 3 languages, it might even entertain players habitually refractory of this kind of game.</desc>

		<desc>A motorcycle racing game recreating the now-defunct 80cc world motorcycle racing championship. It was licensed around Spanish ace Jorge Martinez 'Aspar', and your (and his) racing rivals including future 500cc World Champion Alex Criville. The game features a full practice mode as well as qualifying and races. There are only 8 computer bikes, although the real life championship points system is used, meaning that the penalty for not finishing is bigger than in real life, especially as you only have 5 bikes to last the season. The game is viewed from overhead, and the controls are, unusually, direction based, so to take a straight which (in the overhead view) involves going up and to the right, you must push the joystick in that direction.</desc>

It is your job as a truck driver to deliver your cargo despite all dangers. Asphalt is a top-down shooter, you don't have to worry about driving (the road is as straight as it can be), all you have to do is shoot your opponents before they have a chance to do too much damage to your vehicle. You have a machine gun turret with unlimited ammunition, a flamethrower and some mines, as well as a damage display to see what part of the truck needs to be protected. The difficulty is rather progressive, each new level bringing new, better armed opponents, requiring new tactics to defeat them without damaging your vehicle too much. You can also grab some bonuses like extra ammo, instant repair or bonus points.</desc>

		<name>Atlantis</name>
		<desc>The advanced civilization of the planet Somerset built a gigantic exploratory spaceship called Atlantis, and sent it to research the planet Earth. After the completion of its task, the ship submerged to an oceanic abyss. The D.A.G. ("giant-looking depredators"), a war-mongering civilization, took possession of Atlantis with the intention of conquering Somerset and the universe. Somerset sends a hero to rescue Atlantis from the enemy, and return it home. Rescue from Atlantis is a Spanish side-scrolling action-adventure game divided in three loads: 1. In the first load, the hero must find a way to gain entrance to the camouflage city built on top of Atlantis. This level starts with the bathysphere being dropped from the sky into the ocean by a spaceship. Once it hits the bottom, the player can guide it by using O and P to move left and right, respectively. Q makes it go up, and A cycles through its inventory. The bathysphere is armed with a laser gun that can be fired by pressing the SPACE bar. Hitting M ejects the protagonist from the bathysphere as to explore more strait entrances. Once out, M also serves as the GET, DROP, ENTER and USE button. There are objects scattered on the sea floor to be collected and used. The bathysphere also comes with some useful paraphernalia: ? A laser pistol to kill the enemy and the sea life; ? A jetpack to reach higher places; ? A portable computer to connect with the main one in Atlantis; ? A mould to fabricate gold bars. There are some gold nuggets on the submersed caves (to melt them the player has to find a source of heat); ? A first-aid kit that can only be used once. The player investigates a complex of aquatic tunnels while collecting the needed tools for the task ahead. At the top of the screen there are two horizontal bars. The leftmost indicates the oxygen level (there are places on the levels that replenish it). The one in the right side is the bathysphere fuel level, once empty the vessel will stop moving. The player must find sources of fuel to make it swim again. Amongst the two bars sits the inventory of both the bathysphere and the character. At the bottom of the screen there are two scores and a plant between them. The plant is the energy level of the character, it changes with every hit he/she/it receives. The left score is the current score, the one on the right is the top score. In this first load, the main danger comes from the creatures of the sea: octopuses, sharks and abyssal fishes take a bit of the energy when the character touches them. In the second load the bathysphere enters the city that was raised on Atlantis, now under the sea and in ruins. Guarding the entrance to the ship is Korx, a powerful D.A.G. mage. The main objective of this level is to find a way to destroy him (he is invulnerable to the laser weapons). Besides the animals of the previous load, the character has to fight hammerheads and some alien creatures. The final load sees the bathysphere entering Atlantis. The ship is a mechanical labyrinth, with lifts and sentinel robots. The main objective is to find the computer room, where the hero can activate the ship and bring it back to Somerset. The game has a password system: after solving each load, an alphanumeric code is displayed on the screen. The code is generated based on the actions accomplished. The second and third load require this code to start. It is possible to reach an unwinnable situation by failing to collect or assemble the necessary objects for the completion of a later level.</desc>

		<desc>You are driving a small car, in a small town where the streets are swamped in atoms. These can be shot and must be avoided. There are power-ups to freeze atoms for a time. There are also barriers in the road, which must be shot, but can't be shot while you are right next to them. The road network is complex and mazelike, with only a small amount on screen at a time, so a sense of direction is required. You only have one life, so a crash with an atom in town means the end of your driving. Score you earned will be written in Hi-Scores table.</desc>

The game features a succession of courses, which must be navigated in 30 seconds. You must run to the vehicle initially, and will also have to manually remount if you fall off - all costing you more precious time. Careful use of the wheelies and jumps is crucial to completion. Each hazard must be taken at the right speed, which you'll learn through experience.</desc>

		<desc>In Monty On the Run the intrepid coal thief Monty Mole fled to the rocky island of Gibraltar. However, the Intermole agency is on to him, and his only hope of escape is to trek across Europe, collecting enough cash to buy the Greek island of Montoss and live there in luxury. This is Monty's third game, and the structure is similar to the previous two. It's platform and ladders based, with 80 screens each representing some area of Europe - the Eiffel Tower and the Leaning Tower of Pisa are among the identifiable landmarks. There are different ways of travelling through the levels - some bouncy platforms coupled with a new super-leap move allow for big progress to be made, while Monty can also suspend from the ceilings and dodge his way across. Monty can now fall without being hurt, although landing on water can cause multiple lives to be lost in quick succession. There are many items to collect - the most important are Eurocheques for money and airplane tickets. Once on a plane you must fight off the encroaching Intermole planes for extra points.</desc>

Your quest to recover the scroll and avenge your father's death is viewed from above and superficially resembles Gauntlet. You start outside the Quench Heart Keep, and must initially find enough keys in the grounds and connected buildings to penetrate it, and then kill each of the 3 guards. There are other prey including spiders to fend off - these know how to home in on you. You are armed with a limited number of Shuikch to shoot from distance; after these are gone you are reliant on your bare hand, although more can be collected. Pressing the 1 key summons an energy recharge from the God Kwon, but only a limited number of times.</desc>

The maze is comprised of different rooms, and, more often than not, each room has a monster that you need to avoid. When you come in contact with a monster, or use your jetpack, your fuel level decreases. When the fuel gauge is empty, you will lose one of your lives. Along the way, you will pass containers that store various chemicals, and you will be able to carry only one chemical at once, but you can switch the chemicals around.

		<name>Back to the Future</name>
		<desc>Based on the 1985 time travel flick, Electric Dreams' Back to the Future for the Commodore 64 (and ported to the ZX Spectrum) differs significantly from LJN's version on the NES. The player takes control of teenager Marty McFly; zapped into the past by an experiment gone wrong. To preserve Marty's future existence, the player must lure Marty's mother-to-be into spending more time with his father, while avoiding the school bully. These computer-controlled characters will wander the game areas and interact with each other according to basic rules - Marty's mother will follow him around, his father will avoid the bully, the bully will knock Marty out if their paths should cross, etc. If left to their own devices, Marty's parents will not meet and his time will run out (indicated by a fading family photo). The game world consists of five distinct areas, each the size of one screen. A separate &amp;quot;hub&amp;quot; area scrolls past the entrances to these five zones. Each of the five areas holds a collectable item, with a different effect (attract, repel, or no effect) on each character. A skateboard can also be collected to travel across the hub faster. The player must use their collected items to keep Marty's mother and father in close proximity, while also keeping the bully away.</desc>

		<desc>Back to the Future III is a collection of four arcade games. Marty McFly and Doc Brown have traveled back through time to the year 1885 - and they're soon deep in trouble when they face "Mad Dog" Tannen's gang and have to find a way to return to the present. This game takes four scenes from the Hollywood movie Back to the Future III and turns them into arcade sequences: 1. Buckboard Chase: Doc Brown goes horseback in an attempt to save Hill Valley's lovely school teacher Clara. This game of quick ducking, jumping and shooting alternates between a side-scrolling and a top-down perspective. 2. Shooting Gallery: The name says it all. A classic game of aim-and-shoot, spiced up by hidden extras and bonus targets. 3. Pie Throwing: Meet the Mad Dog gang. They have guns, and you have... cream pies. It's an isometric version of the shooting gallery, only with ammo. And the targets shoot back. 4. The Train: Basically a side-scrolling beat-em-up on train wagons with some ducking and jumping. Get rid of the mechanics and collect speed logs to push the engine to a magic 88 mph.</desc>

		<name>Back to the Future Part III</name>
		<desc>Back to the Future III is a collection of four arcade games. Marty McFly and Doc Brown have traveled back through time to the year 1885 - and they're soon deep in trouble when they face "Mad Dog" Tannen's gang and have to find a way to return to the present. This game takes four scenes from the Hollywood movie Back to the Future III and turns them into arcade sequences: 1. Buckboard Chase: Doc Brown goes horseback in an attempt to save Hill Valley's lovely school teacher Clara. This game of quick ducking, jumping and shooting alternates between a side-scrolling and a top-down perspective. 2. Shooting Gallery: The name says it all. A classic game of aim-and-shoot, spiced up by hidden extras and bonus targets. 3. Pie Throwing: Meet the Mad Dog gang. They have guns, and you have... cream pies. It's an isometric version of the shooting gallery, only with ammo. And the targets shoot back. 4. The Train: Basically a side-scrolling beat-em-up on train wagons with some ducking and jumping.

		<desc>The game is flowing inside the body of critically ill patient. You as Bactron - a yellow blob of antibiotics - should reactivate the enzymes which have been sterilized by the viruses spreading within the body. Exploring the area representing the body you should move from one screen to another using certain doors, solve the labyrinths, push/pull obstacles to move further, avoid the viruses which will drain your energy if you touch them, spit at them to make them frozen for some time, locate the enzymes in the patient's body, and activate them. You should be quick, because more viruses are being produced and the patient's temperature is rising. The enzymes are shown as yellow cubes, and activating them boosts Bactron's energy, but don't touch the light blue cubes!</desc>

		<desc>Badlands continued the Super Sprint lineage, but moved the game into a futuristic post-apocalyptic setting. The races consist of 3 souped-up cars toughing it out over 4 laps on one of the 8 tracks, which are viewed from above. Two human players can take part, but only the winner continues without using up credits, so you will only see the early races in two-player mode. You are armed with guns, which can be used to slow opposing cars. During the races spanners can be collected, which are then cashed in for upgraded turbos, improved weaponry and engine upgrades. Hazards on the later tracks include ramps, bridges, buildings collapsing onto the track and barriers which open and close in a random sequence.</desc>

		<desc>In the year 3037, the most competitive sport in the known universe is Ballblazer. For the first time ever, humans from the planet Earth have won the right to compete in the final round of the Ballblazer Championship, to fight for Earth's honor and the title Masterblazer! Ballblazer is a 3D futuristic soccer-like game, where the player (inside a Rotofoil) is set on a one-on-one 1,155 square playing field (the Grid). The objective of the player to kick a floating ball (Plasmorb) inside the opponent's goal (Goalbeams). A player may compete against a human or computer opponent. The Rotofoil is equipped with a multi-purpose forcefield. This forcefield when in short distance of the Plasmorb will act as a pull field, automatically pulling the Plasmorb towards to player. When a player in possession of the Plasmorb shoots, the forcefield will act as push field and launches the ball. When the match starts, the player must move down field and attempt to gain possession of the Plasmorb using the joystick and blast the Plasmorb to an intended direction. The player should also be aware that the Goldbeams move slightly every second and the distance between them will shrink. The highest scoring goals are goals made when Goldbeams have disappeared across the horizon (Over The Horizon/OTH shots). A player may also attempt to steal possession of a Plasmorb by rushing beside the opponent and blast the Plasmorb away. The game ends when time runs out or a player wins 10 consecutive goals. If the game ends in a draw, over-time will apply and the first player to score will win the game. Scoring Close-in goals - 1 point Goals near Goldbeams - 2 points OTH shots - 3 points Players may steal points from each other by making goals. The total combined score of both players cannot accede more than 10 points. A player winning 10 consecutive points automatically wins the game.</desc>

		<desc>Robin was repairing the Batmobile when he was kidnapped. Before Batman can contemplate rescuing him, he must reassemble the car from its seven parts. There are all over the Batcave, in this isometric arcade adventure taking in over 150 screens. Initially Batman lacks his super powers, which must be collected. The Batbag allows you to pick up and drop objects, Jet Batboots allow you to jump, the Thruster allows Road-Runnering (movement while you fall), and the Low Gravity Batbelt keeps you in the air for longer.

		<desc>Robin was repairing the Batmobile when he was kidnapped. Before Batman can contemplate rescuing him, he must reassemble the car from its seven parts. There are all over the Batcave, in this isometric arcade adventure taking in over 150 screens. Initially Batman lacks his super powers, which must be collected. The Batbag allows you to pick up and drop objects, Jet Batboots allow you to jump, the Thruster allows Road-Runnering (movement while you fall), and the Low Gravity Batbelt keeps you in the air for longer. Short-term bonuses of invincibility, extra energy, and extra life and an enhanced jump can be collected, but there is also one which neutralises all power-ups. You have eight lives, but each cluster of Batstones acts as a restart point - when it is game over you can return to that spot, with lives and equipment as they were.</desc>

		<desc>Battle of the Planets is based on a science-fiction children's cartoon series of the same name. Zoltar and his forces are attacking your solar system and its five planets - Xenath, Elias, Horaf, Olixal and Pete. As a G-Force space fighter armed with a Phoenix ship, you must repel each of these attacks, by destroying enough of Zoltar's craft to prevent the attacks from succeeding. The action unfolds through the window of your craft, with various types of enemy craft approaching and needing to be shot with your lasers or torpedoes. Once you have targeted an enemy, you must keep the enemy craft in your sights until it has been destroyed. There are five status screens to keep track of - shield strength, power stability, rocket status, laser status (it can overheat with constant use) and the current situation on the planet you are defending. To land on a planet you must fly towards its target on screen, and enter the docking bay. You will have to take out landers, using your rocket system. This is also your chance to repair and re-fuel your craft.</desc>

		<desc>This side-view shoot 'em up involves trying to retrieve two nuclear weapons which have been stolen by terrorists. These are located at opposite ends of the playing area, so you can pursue them in either order. Needless to say, the terrorists have plenty of forces out to prevent you getting too far. Unusually, the game features both a helicopter and a tank - you choose either from the base, and can fly/drive back there to change. The best strategy is to use the helicopter to shoot out air-based enemies and repair the various bridges, then return for the tank. You get 4000 seconds in which to complete all this, and losing a life costs you 500 of these.</desc>

		<path>./Batty (Europe).zip</path>
		<name>Batty</name>
		<desc>Batty is influenced by Arkanoid's method of reviving the Breakout phenomenon. You control a paddle at the bottom of the screen, with the top half of the screen containing an arrangement of bricks, most of which can be destroyed. You must move the paddle left and right so as to make contact with a ball, and thus deflect it (using the walls at the sides strategically) into the bricks, some of which require multiple hits to destroy. Wipe the destructible bricks out, and you move on to the next level; fail to keep the ball in play and you lose one of your 5 lives. Some destroyed bricks release power-up tokens, which must be 'caught' with the bat as they fall. Functions include multi-ball, a larger paddle, and the ability to 'catch' and relaunch the ball each time, which makes it a lot easier to gain access to precise bricks or areas. Batty also has enemies flying around and dropping bombs towards you - the bombs cause your bat to stick for a second, perhaps costing a life. Many levels contain magnets at the top of the screen, which make the ball's path harder to predict. The two player mode gives each player access to half the playfield, so co-operation is required.</desc>

		<desc>Help the evil Dr. Cirilus through his research and try to rule over the world. Extract the energy from the videogames esential crystals, assemble it wisely and the universe will be yours, do it quickly, these blends are too unstable. If you don't get it at time all will explode in your face. Anyway, don't worry, you are not alone: Cirilus assistants will try to make it easy, though...they don't get all their aims. HISTORY From years of research, Dr. Cirilus discovered the way to extract the energy from the Videogames essential crystals. In his Lab, he developed the technology to stabilize these crystals and storage the energy as it is produced. In his effort, he relies on his faithfull but incompetent servant, Loppo Noroccidental, who is entrusted to provide stabilizer elements to the blend. But the mad Scientific has found several unexpected handicaps: In spite of this improved technique, the crystals become unstable by the contact with oxigen: Handle the crystals as fast as possible to avoid explosions in the laboratory facilities. In the other hand, more crystal purity needs more links among them. Any other way will not get the required energy. His initial research success caught the attention of the Galaxy X-32 where they will not hesitate to send the best agent and hinder the evil Cirilus's plans. THE GAME Your goal is joining crystals in order to release their energy. To do that, crystals must be aligned in rows or columns of at least three. When that happens, they will disappear leaving space which will be inmediately taken by crystals above them. Fetch which crystal to move with the blinking cursor, then select and move it. The crystal will exchange positions with a contiguous one (depending on which direction you moved it). If the result of your move doesn't make three or more crystals of the same kind align, it will be undone and the crystals will return to their original position. The amount of energy you need to release from each kind of crystals is displayed on screen. Once you've gathered enough energy, you'll get to the next level. GAME MODES - Arcade: Main game mode. Follow the story of Cirilo and help him in his endeavour to rule the world. A different set of crystals awaits each five levels. Besides, from the sixth level onwards, in addition to coloured crystals to join and destroy you'll find special crystals, some of which are extremely useful - but some of them are quite dangerous. - Normal mode: Choose a graphic set and try to get the higher score in this straightforward mode, without special crystals. - Special mode: Like "normal mode" but with special crystals. You have to play at least until 6th level in Arcade mode to unlock this feature. In any game mode, crystals marked "extra" will give you double score. GRAPHICS SETS As you progess in the game, the "crystal set" will change, unlocking it for use in the others game modes. CONTROLS You can play using joystick, or with following keys: O -&gt; LEFT P -&gt; RIGHT Q -&gt; UP A -&gt; DOWN SPACE -&gt; FIRE / SELECT ESC -&gt; PAUSE (Press ESC once, then any other key to resume game) / ABORT GAME (Press ESC twice) Press fire into menu, and program will detect automaticly wich type of control are you using.</desc>

First Axel Foley visits a warehouse to shoot out some bad guys in a Green Beret-influenced sequence. The second level (first on the C64 version) involves driving after 3 lorries full of weapons, and shooting them out one by one, Chase HQ-style. Avoid contact and stay on the road to complete this. Next you must cross the grounds of a mansion, shooting anyone who gets in your way. The final section is set within the mansion, and is first-person 3D, although with few movement angles and only one enemy on screen at a time.</desc>

		<name>How to be a Hero</name>
		<desc>This Gauntlet-inspired arcade adventure has three separate challenges, each of which can be loaded from the main screen. All are viewed from above, and involve shooting enemies (contact with whom drains your energy). Your health is represented by gradually-withering pineapples, which are recharged by eating food. The first is set in Egypt - you are locked inside a treasure-packed temple, and must escape through seven locked doors, each of which has its own key. The second sees you on a doomed spaceship, needing to collect security passes and circuit board pieces. The third is in a city full of mutants - escape passages are locked and a crucial document is in 24 pieces. The minimum target of escaping involves collecting keys - note that each barrier has only one way of being opened. To be a true hero, you must collect the sets of 24 treasure pieces/circuit board pieces/torn document pieces within the levels.</desc>

		<desc>In this tie-in to the 1986 John Carpenter movie starring Kurt Russell, you must thwart the evil plans of Mandarin Lo Pan who has kidnapped two green-eyed girls in order to marry and sacrifice them in order to become mortal again. You play as 3 characters, one at a time, in this action platformer: - Jack Burton, a burly but bit dumb action hero who fights with fists and later with a "Bushmaster" gun. Ammo must be found to be able to keep using it. - Wang Chi, whose girlfriend along with Jack's has been kidnapped, uses Martial Arts and later a sword when found. More swords will be needed as they will break after awhile. - Egg Shen is a magician who has vowed to stop the ancient prophecy from coming about, and fights with magic bolts which can turn later on into more powerful lightning if magic potions are found. Each character has an energy status bar at bottom of screen represented by a Yin and Yang Symbol that slowly disappears but can be replenished by finding food. A weapons symbol is shown if they possess it and magic potion symbol will give them extra strength if found. You must alternate among the 3 characters to keep their status from falling too low and dying, and each has to pick up their own appropriate weapons. They all can move forwards and backwards, jump, duck and attack at different heights. They have to fight through several levels including the streets of Chinatown, where martial artist enemies await and gunmen that must be avoided until more experience is gathered. Further on, you go into the sewers where additional monsters must be avoided by jumping over them. Then they will reach the rooms of the underground lair of Lo Pan where large-hat wearing elementals called Storms await. The final battle takes place in the Marriage chamber where armoured warriors and the levitating Lo Pan must be vanquished in order to free the kidnapped girls.</desc>

		<name>Biggles</name>
		<desc>WE Johns tales of a brave World War 1 pilot were updated for a 1980s feature film, with a plot involving Jim, Biggles brother who lives in that era. Jim travels back through time to warn Biggles of a spectacular weapon the Germans have created, with the intention of changing history  for the worse. The game is split into two separate games, and the first of these is itself split into three sub-games. The first of these is a side-view flight game, in which you must shoot down and dodge Fokkers who come at you from the right of the screen in your rickety plane, with a machine gun and bombs on board. Part two is set in modern-day London, and the characters must jump across a network of roofs in order to obtain a secret code. There are guards to avoid, and big gaps between roofs to avoid. The third part is a side-view game inspired by Green Beret, with a gun to fire at encroaching enemies, gameplay on multiple vertical levels, and grenades to collect. Lose a life in any of these and you will cycle back through them. The second game is a more serious flight simulation however. A helicopter is beamed back in time for our intrepid hero to use. You must first go to the Allied camp to get the secret weapons location (and you will need the password from part one of the game for this), and then head to that location to destroy it and save the world.</desc>

		<name>Birdie</name>
		<desc>If you had dreams to be a bird, this game will make them true. Here you are a Birdie in some sci-fi world filled with robots, carnivorous plants, parachutes, raptors, barbarians, lasers, butterflies, magical doors, hyperspace, etc. You should survive in this world with help of your wings and flying techniques. The game is flown in third-person view, where you may control a bird moving him/her left or right, flying up or descending down, and flapping the wings. To fly correctly, the bird has to move in the air at a certain speed. Once the latter increases, the bird is handy. If bird's speed drops below a certain threshold, the bird then follows one of the oldest laws of the universe, gravity. Flapping wings enables bird to gain altitude and flying down on the wings increases speed. The scoreboard on the screen tells you your speed (red = stall), altitude, the remaining time before the night, your life energy (no energy = game over). Flying at altitude for too long will attract predators, give no points, and exhaust the energy unnecessarily. Eating butterflies allows you to recover energy, but remember that eating too much makes you aggressive! The environment, where Birdie is flying, will change during the game. Starting in the forest, you will visit other dimensions through Magical Doors as well as descend the dungeons, and even meet lamas.</desc>

		<name>Blade Runner</name>
		<desc>Based on the movie of the same name. You have been assigned by the police force to track down and eliminate any replidroids that have landed on Earth. There are six types of replidroids, labeled Replidroid 1 through 6. The higher the number, the more intelligent it is. The majority of the game is viewed from inside your skimmer, and inside of your skimmer are three displays that you need to pay attention to. The main display displays a radar view of your area, allowing you to navigate the streets in search of replidroids (which are represented by octagons with crosses inside them). To the right of this is a smaller display which shows the whole city and your position in relation to the replidroid's. Below this is a text readout giving information on the number and type of replidroids within the vicinity. In the main display, your position is represented by a yellow cursor which you can use to navigate the streets with. If you find a replidroid, you can hover over it and press the fire button. Doing so will put you in pursue mode where you automatically land. After you get out, you must hunt down said replidroid in a busy street. There is a scanner in which you can use to keep track of where it is. The replidroid is represented as a green square. The further you progress, the closer you are to them. If the replidroid gets out of range, your skimmer automatically picks you up, and you have to hunt down replidroids elsewhere. Once you catch up with it, you must match your position with theirs and shoot at them in order to get the bounty displayed in the status bar. Your scanner also shows oncoming traffic that must be avoided. What it does not show, however, is people which you must dodge. If you crash into people, the game ends.</desc>

In this case the Asteroids are protecting Mukor, an evil being who is poisoning planets under the Colonising Corps control. Each level is split into either 9 or 16 sub-levels, which are chosen through a square in which any remaining level which is adjacent to the last level completed can be selected. There are 3 different ships (Speeder, Fighter and Warrior), which can be switched between at any time. Power-ups (including improved weapons, shield recharges and a faster thrust) can be collected by flying into them.</desc>

The main player is surrounded by a large tank which moves around as if you are walking it Flintstones style. Gameplay follows the usual pattern for Ikari Warriors-style games - kill off the bazooka-toting baddies, which emerge from hiding places or enter the screen in waves. You can do this by either shooting them or running them over with your tank. Parts of the scenery often block your path and need destroying. Once you clear the level you are confronted by a boss, which in the first level is an enormous tank which you have to disable the guns of.</desc>

		<desc>Impact is an old break-out style game. The user controls a paddle and needs to catch a ball with the paddle each time it comes down. When the ball hits a brick, it is destroyed (unless it's made undestroyable). Sometimes, a bonus will come out of the brick. This adds to the 'bonus score'. When the player collected one or more bonuses, he may 'release' them, and he receives a powerup. Each 'bonus score' has a different powerup: the most powerful powerups need the largest number of bonus points. Impact comes with a lot of levels and a level editor.</desc>

There are six tracks in the game, complete with stunts and wheelies that the player must accomplish in order to proceed onto the next track. Riding the bike causes energy to be lost, but soda cans can be collected to replenish it. Also, doing stunts causes the player to crash down hard, losing spokes (wheels). Replacement spokes, like the soda cans, can be collected along the way. The game ends when the player does not qualify, runs out of time, or has no spokes left.</desc>

In order to protect your street cred, and thus keep your girlfriend interested in you (can't he get someone less superficial next time?), you must defeat them all. The game scrolls sideways, and puts you on your bike with a spin attack to deal with enemy bikes, skateboarders and scooters. 8 bikes must be beaten to move onto the next level, however this total is reset if you lose a life.

There are 7 courses of increasing difficulty, incorporating ramps and bumps which significantly affect the bike's handling. Each course has a time limit you must complete 3 laps of the course within, or it's game over. The further inside the time limit you are, the more points you score. There's a computer opponent, but the scoring isn't affected by whether you beat him just so long as you qualify. There is a two-player mode. A unique feature at the time is the action replay, which can be viewed in slow motion.</desc>

		<desc>In Bomb Jack, the player controls Jack, who must collect all the bombs in order to complete the current round and go onto the next one. This sounds easy, right? Wrong! Making Jack's task difficult are numerous enemies such as birds, mummies, turtles, and orbs. In each round, collecting a number of bombs results in a bonus coin appearing, and collecting this coin will make the player's score increase 2 to 4 times. More often than not, the "power ball" appears, and when you collect this, you can defeat enemies and have more time to collect all the bombs. There is also the "E" coin, which gives Jack one additional life, but rarely does this coin appear. The more you progress through the game, the more difficult it becomes, as enemies travel more quickly to get you.</desc>

		<desc>Having saved the world in the first game, Bomb Jack is out to collect as much gold as possible, which is lying on a number of ledges. These vary between open and shut - the open ones offer more points, and an extra life is on offer for collecting 10 in a row, so if possible the route should take in the open ones in order. Gameplay differs from the original, in that Bombjack's movement is no longer free and self-propelled. Instead, he moves flick-style between ledges, so long as one is directly within one of the 4 compass directions. Baddies can be pushed off ledges, but this uses up some of Jack's limited energy.</desc>

		<desc>Mobo and Robo Bonanza are enjoying their favorite television show when the picture crackles and a shadowy figure of a mysterious stranger appears on screen. This figure asks them to collect certain items that he has placed inside various buildings to test his security force. If they return the items successfully, Mobo and Robo will be rewarded. The two of them state that they will get the job done in just three minutes. However, little do they know that each building is packed with security guards who will raise the alarm if they are caught red-handed. Fortunately both Mobo and Robo are equipped with bullets that can knock the guards unconscious for a few seconds. An $100 reward will be given out if Mobo and Robo are apprehended. As either Mobo or Robo, you must collect all the treasures before leaving the ten buildings and shoot any security guards that get in your way. Remember that you are under a time limit. An in-game map will help you locate the treasures. There is a bonus stage after three buildings, where the object is to collect the gold bars in a limited amount of time without one of the three spotlights shining on you. If it is possible, hide behind open doors. If you manage to get all the gold bars, 10,000 points is added to your score. There are three of these bonus stages, but each of them varies.</desc>

		<desc>Booly is a puzzle game with a similar concept to GemX in some ways. You are presented with a top-down view of an array of inter-connected blocks, which are shown in a variety of colours. The aim is to turn them all to grey, but clicking on them (using the pointer you are in control of) will often cause a pattern of other squares to change to the next colour in the sequence as well. You are doing all this with a time limit for each of the 300 levels. A level designer allows you to create your own sequence of up to 1000 levels.</desc>

The ship is viewed side-on in a platform-type perspective, and contains 20 holds, each of which is split across 8 screens of treasure. Once you have cleared each one, you have 45 seconds to escape the hold and prepare for the next one. The levels all feature lots of doors, each of which has its own key to open it - these are numbered. As only one key can be held at a time (pick another up and the first one returns to its original location), and many of the enemies are located behind doors, a great deal of strategy as to which order you collect these in is required.</desc>

		<name>Bored of the Rings</name>
		<desc>No prizes for guessing the inspiration for this one. The Great Ring needs to be returned to Mount Doom, a treacherous task to be undertaken by Fordo the Boggit. Spam, Pimply and Murky are his country-bumpkin friends, and he will later meet with Bumbadil and Hashberry, two old hippies. The main quest involves meeting up with Legoland the Elf, Giblet the Dwarf and Aragont. In keeping with the humour, familiar locations become "the featureless plain below the pink mountain", "Lake Anadin" and the "Land of the Personal-Stereo-Wearing Goblins". Bored of the Rings is an interactive fiction game with graphics made using Quill. The interface allows the player to take and use items using VERB NOUN commands, and talk to characters. The game is split into three parts, accessed via passcodes. The tape also includes issue 1 of Sceptical, Delta 4's short-lived magazine on tape.</desc>

		<name>Bosconian '87</name>
		<desc>This older arcade game got a budget-priced home conversion. Fighting it out above the earth for a newly-reunited people, you must shoot out the alien craft to depend your people. The game is a top-down shoot 'em up, with aliens to kill and rocks to destroy. Each wave has several Space Stations, and destroying these is the ultimate goal. A scanner helps you find these. The ship can be brought to a stop, or flown in any of the four main directions. You must watch the fuel gauge, but extra fuel and improved weapons can be collected. There is a mothership which can be docked with for shielding.</desc>

		<desc>You're Rockford and have to dig through monster infested caves in search of diamonds. In each level you must collect a certain number of these diamonds, in order to open a portal to the next stage. Enemies can be squashed by falling boulders, which are released when the ground below them is removed or they are pushed onto empty ground, but be careful because these can also squash you. In later levels, difficulty is increased by many puzzle elements and shorter time limits.</desc>

The player has to move the ball around between two bounces so it lands on friendly areas like grass or the main hexagonal-patterned floor. If it lands hazardous areas like spikes and sand, or hits the enemies which move around, one of the seven lives the player starts with is lost. There are beneficial squares though - arrows which keep the ball in the air longer or teleports which clear part of the game. The 174 screens are divided into 10 levels - at the end of each of these there's a bonus screen.</desc>

		<desc>The planet of New Texas is similar to the Wild West-era Texas - mystic Indians, bar-room brawlers and sharp-shooting mercenaries. The only man tough enough to keep order in such a place is Marshall Bravestarr. Stampede is the villain of the piece; he aims to bring the dead back to life as zombies for his own use. BraveStarr is a side-scrolling action title based on the popular 80's space western cartoon series. Starting with a limited amount of time, you must find and rescue Shamen who was captured by the evil Tex Hex, to aid Stampede's plans. You get nine minutes to complete your task. The game begins in Fort Kerium in front of the bar. You can enter buildings, to talk to people and examine rooms. Outside, you must jump around, shoot enemies and collect various power-ups they drop. Marshall BraveStarr has only one life - when he takes damage, he loses time instead of life energy.</desc>

Brian must wander through 100 locations looking for the Crown Jewels and sit on the throne. Objects are scattered throughout each location, and Brian needs to figure out their purpose. Monsters  such as ducks, Daleks, Mad Scotsmen, and Turkish soldiers  roam each location making Brian's task of getting these objects difficult. Up to three objects can be carried at any one time, and they can be used to block the path of monsters or to make extra platforms. The objects do not fall when dropped, making it easier for Brian to leap across blank areas. Getting the correct objects in the correct places is a daunting task.</desc>

		<desc>The late martial arts hero features in this platform game, with the aim of reaching a wizard in an underground lair, defeat of whom can offer him untold wealth. In each area you must collect the many strategically-placed lanterns before exiting through the newly-revealed passageway. Some rooms also have escalator-type sections to run along, and the standard (although slightly illogical in this context) ladders. On the way, you'll fight two enemies - a ninja and a green sumo warrior named Yamo. You can defeat them by punching, kicking, dropping on their heads or luring them into hazardous terrain, or even by making them accidentally hit each other. Even after they are killed, however, they keep coming back for more after a few seconds. Since they can move pretty intelligently (they even climb ladders), you should watch out for them. There are lots of hazards to avoid by either walking round or jumping - walls of electrical charge and exploding bushes for example.</desc>

		<desc>Bubble Bobble is the story of two humans, Bub and Bob who wander into the mysterious cave of monsters and magically turn into dinosaurs. The only way to transform back is to reach the end of the cave... Bubble Bobble is a platform game, with each level being a single screen. The enemies must be cleared from a level to go to the next one. With one player controlling Bub and the other controlling Bob, the player can jump and collect items for points (such as fruit). The real power Bub and Bob have however is the ability to blow bubbles. These bubbles can be as platforms to leap on, or to trap enemies. Enemies trapped in a bubble must be popped by jumping into them, wherein they'll turn to fruit. Additionally, power-ups sometimes float by in bubbles. They include lightning, which flies out horizontally at enemies, and water, which drags the player and enemies straight down flowing over platforms. Taking too long to complete any level will summon Baron Von Blubba, who will float around the screen trying to destroy the player.</desc>

It was developed with the purpose of running on any CPC machine, regardless of RAM size or CRTC model, while staying as faithful to the original game as it could be done in 48 kB of code and data. BB4CPC was developed by me, "CNGSOFT". BB4CPC is freeware; it is provided "as is" with no warranty. Being a fan work, the copyright of the original arcade game belongs to Taito; I just hold rights over this remake. The gameplay The player assumes the role of a cute baby dragon whose single weapon is his bubble breath: he can defeat his enemies by blowing bubbles at them, then popping these before they break free of their soap prison and strike back. The game is made of 100 stages plagued by monsters whose contact is lethal to the player; by defeating all monsters in a stage, the player can move on to the next stage. But beware, time is limited: at the first warning, monsters will turn red, faster and more aggressive; the second warning will spawn an invulnerable monster who hunts the player! Fortunately, the game provides items that boost the player's score and supply him with power-ups, and two players can play at once and cooperate in their quest through the cave of monsters. And the bubbles themselves can be very useful for reaching far or high locations too! The default controls are both joysticks (FIRE1: shoot bubbles, FIRE2: jump) but players can redefine them if needed. The key P pauses and unpauses the game, and ESCAPE aborts it and returns to the title screen.</desc>

		<name>Bubble Dizzy</name>
		<desc>Bubble Dizzy eschews the usual arcade adventure format of Dizzy games, instead being a simple action game. You must guide Dizzy through the underwater worlds, collecting pearls as you go. Dizzy starts at the bottom of the sea, and you have to get him to the top. You do this by jumping across bubbles, which only have a limited time before bursting. Enemies to avoid include sharks, octopuses and swordfish. Dizzy has limited oxygen, but more can be collected from O2 canisters. After completing a level, you get a bonus for the amount of pearls you collected and the amount of oxygen you have left.</desc>

The bubble's direction is affected by which part of the ghost hits it. Candles, fans, and other obstacles serve to make little Bubble Ghost's task harder. Bubble Ghost is invincible, but the bubble is prone to bursting if it hits anything at pace. You have five bubbles before the game is over.</desc>

		<name>Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show</name>
		<desc>Buffalo Bill presents a collection of six Wild West themed mini-games, which hang together around humour-lead presentation and backdrops.You can play as many or as few of these as you like, and can always have another go at them if you fail. First task is to throw knives at a spinning board upon which a surely-terrified and fortunately-skinny lady is locked - make sure to adjust for the rotation that will occur in the time your shot takes to hit. You get points for missing as many times as possible before hitting. Event 2 is based on shooting ability and is in two stages. First you must shoot the targets of criminals (but not innocents) as they emerge from the ground, next you must shoot the bottles they throw at you from over the horizon. Event 3 is Calf Roping, in which you must position yourself so as to be able to throw your rope around the poor cow's neck. This is followed by Bronco Riding, in which you must adjust your balance to compensate for the Bronco trying to throw you off, by pushing the joystick out to balance two bars. Level 5 starts off like the Cow Roping, as you jump onto a Steer, before a joystick-waggling section starts. Last of all is a side-scrolling game in which you jump onto a stagecoach which has been invaded by Indians, and beat up the hijacker.</desc>

		<path>./Bulls Eye (Europe).zip</path>
		<name>Bullseye</name>
		<desc>A computer game version of a famed TV quiz show based around the game of darts. The computer version features 2 players, both human-controlled - on TV there were 3 teams of 2 (one amateur darts player and one to answer questions) The first round uses a custom board which is split both inwards (4 separate grades representing 30,50,100 and 200 points respectively) and around (10 sections lettered A-K, representing a different subject each). The first player must choose a category to aim at, and shoot a dart at it. If they hit one of the sections for that letter, they get that score and are asked the question. If they hit another category they get no bonus but are asked that question - if it's still there. Each players gets 3 goes at this, with increasingly tough questions worth 30,50,100 points. Round 2 involves each player throwing 3 darts at a standard board, with the player who scores the most getting asked a question, with the value of the darts on offer. If they get it wrong, the other player gets a chance, for the points THEY scored. This is repeated 3 times. After these 2 rounds, the player who is in front gets to aim at a board with 8 black segments, 8 red ones and the bullseye. The bully scores 50 points, the others reds score a randomly-selected value between 15 and 45, the blacks score zero, and hitting a red for the second time loses you that prize - hence the presenter's catchphrase "keep out of the black and into the red, nothing in this game for 2 in a bed". Once the player has finished the round, they choose whether to gamble their score against the final Prize Board. 101 points must be scored in 4 darts (in the TV show it was 6 - 3 for each player)</desc>

		<desc>The first game in the Bumpy series is, just like its sequels, about a head that can bump a lot. You control whether the head shall bump left or right, and how far up it will bounce, across a series of bouncy platforms. Once you have picked up all items on the screen, the exit appears so that you can go on to the next screen. While most platforms are perfectly harmless, some have additional qualities, such as being destructible, thereby granting access to other parts of the screen. Some platforms are on fire, which will turn out lethal unless you have picked up a water droplet in advance. Bumpy was remade for 16-bit platforms as Pop-Up, and then ported back once more to the Amstrad CPC.</desc>

		<name>Butcher Hill</name>
		<desc>Intelligence reports suggest that POWs have been captured and are being held hostage at the guerilla outpost on Butcher Hill. The game is divided into three sections. In the first section, players steer their dinghy along a river while avoiding mines and other obstacles. If the dinghy comes into contact with any mine, it explodes. However, when the player has collected ammo, the mines can be destroyed. Coming into contact with rocks causes the dinghy to bounce out of the water for a short distance. When a jetty appears, pressing the fire button allows the player to land and start the next section. The second section has the player finding their way through dense jungle whose path lead to the enemy camp at the base of Butcher Hill. Stopping you from proceeding are soldiers that have orders to shoot you on sight. Mines are also scattered around the jungle floor and must be avoided. If players were able to obtain a compass in the first section, their current direction will be displayed at the right of the control panel. Shooting all the soldiers in the jungle gives the player extra ammunition and stamina. In the final section, players need to destroy the enemy camp by blowing up huts with bullets or grenades. While they are doing that, they must also be on the lookout for any soldiers that tries to leave the camp to bring back more soldiers.</desc>

		<desc>Cabal is a coin-op conversion of Capcom's arcade game. The mechanics of the game are simple: shoot everything in sight! The hero (there is a two player mode) runs back and forth along the bottom of the screen, ducking and dodging bullets and grenades from the enemy. The roll maneuver from the arcade was not implemented in the PC version. You return fire by moving a target around the screen which also moves your character, so be careful not to run into a bullet. The enemies throughout the 5 levels, come thick and fast and there are loads of them, normal foot soldiers, tanks, helicopters and end of level bosses, like submarines and war machines. Just about everything on the screen can be blown up or shot. There are bonus points to be picked up for destroying buildings and weapons to be picked up from the enemy, such as machine- and shot-guns.</desc>

This is the first game dealing with the character, released to all of the Spanish-speaking world's most vital computing platforms at the time: ZX Spectrum, Amstrad CPC, MSX and MS-DOS; all ports except for the PC version contain two different segments, the first a calmer adventure portion followed by some frenetic arcade action. The final mission is to rescue Sigrid, Trueno's beloved, from the monastery of his friend Abbot Estanislao de Castiglione. Along the way, the Capitán will have to face giant spiders, skeleton soldiers, enormous rats and a plethora of imaginative creatures such as the Abbot transformed into a demonic goat. The Capitán strives to triumph over all these opponents with the assistance of his friends sturdy Goliath, who though immobile can lash out with meaty fists and jump in place to cause earthquakes, and nimble Crispín, a man who can shimmy up a rope of any length.</desc>

Does that sound like a job for a retired superhero? Captain Dynamo thinks so, and aims to recapture them for their rightful owner. Gameplay is platform-based, with 12 vertically-scrolling levels, each containing around 50 diamonds - the more of these you can collect, the higher your score. Some will require advance planning to reach, while you will often be dependent on booster pads to reach the higher sections of a level.</desc>

		<name>Carrier Command</name>
		<desc>Carrier Command was one of the first real-time strategy games. You control an advanced cybernetic aircraft carrier complete with fighters, amphibious assault vehicles, laser defenses and a fleet of decoy drones. Your mission is to build a series of resource, factory, and defensive bases spanning an island chain. The only problem? At the other end of the chain is an even more advanced carrier under control of a terrorist organization with the same mission. As you move around the islands you must decide what facilities to build and where they will best support your advance. Resource islands provide materials that factory islands can use to build weapons and vehicles to replace your combat losses but both will be quickly overrun if the enemy attacks them while you are not present. You also have to ensure that your stockpiles of equipment are stored safely until you can find time to launch a resupply drone to bring them to your carrier. From your carrier, you can take first person control of your attack aircraft and amphibious tanks and use them to assault enemy islands or even the enemy carrier itself if you're lucky enough to find it. The weapon payloads on your vehicles are completely configurable based on your needs. An island invasion may require launching a virus bomb that will take over the enemy command systems or just blasting the base with a wire guided surface to surface missile. Ultimately, you have to find and destroy the enemy carrier but, doing so will require a solid supply infrastructure and a strategy for depriving your opponent of his.</desc>

		<desc>Castle Master is the fourth and final individual game to use the Freescape first-person solid 3D game system (after Driller, Dark Side and Total Eclipse). As a Prince or Princess armed with a slingshot, you have to explore a medieval castle to free your beloved from the evil Magister. Gameplay combines action and puzzle-solving, across four primary towers with three levels each. Doors must be opened using one of the ten included keys. These are unmarked, as are the various potions - making it a challenge to know which keys open which doors, and which potions are beneficial. Contact with ghouls drains your energy, as does falling too far (there are narrow pathways to negotiate), while eating cheese can replenish this. Movement and aiming are controlled separately.</desc>

		<desc>Playing a witch, you must assemble the six ingredients required to kill off your arch-rival, an evil pumpkin. The ingredients are all located in underground buildings, each of which can only be entered once you've found the appropriate key. The keys are located overground, and you must fly around on your broom to collect them. The overground sections play like standard shoot 'em ups, as your broom is not affected by gravity and can fire bullets using your magic energy. Bats, fireballs and even seagulls are among the many creatures trying to stop you - contact will cost you more energy than shooting at them would. There are energy recharges on offer. Once you go underground, the gameplay becomes a test of precision platform jumping, including some Manic Miner-esque blind jumps. The six underground sections can be completed in a variety of orders, but you will sometimes reach points that cna't be completed without objects from other sections, so a lot of back-tracking is required. Although you start with nine lives, they won't last all that long at first.</desc>

The game is platform viewed, although your character can move up and suspend at a particular level provided he has lots of fuel - fortunately pods of fuel are plentiful. Enemies patrol the screens, and there are lots of poisonous green patches to avoid - each cost you a life. Most screens have more than one exit, ensuring that a degree of exploration is required. Lots of section are locked behind doors however, and the keys for these are not so plentiful. There are five different types of door - each of these has its corresponding key, although one of these requires 3 different pieces of key to be penetrated. A level designer is built in if you find the game too easy or too hard.</desc>

		<desc>The Anti-Nuclear Party are up to their old tricks again. They have decided to infiltrate a nuclear power station and programmed the robots to empty the containment vault and attack all scientists inside it. To make matters worse, the entire facility will self-destruct in fifty minutes. As one of the scientists that survived the onslaught, the player must prevent this from happening by collecting eighteen fuel canisters scattered around all seven floors of the facility and disposing of them in the pit that lies at the center of the first floor, but only one canister can be carried at a time. If the player comes into contact with any of the robots, their radiation level increases. Once the player becomes totally contaminated, they will die. There are decontamination showers around the facility, and entering them reduces their radiation level. Players are also equipped with a jet-pack that can be used to fly over dangerous areas.</desc>

You are given a mission briefing before you start which gives information on the suspect and what car they drive. Then you drive across the city without crashing into other cars, and catch up with the criminal's car. To arrest the suspects, you must keep bumping into their car until it is no longer functional. And you have to do this under a strict time limit. You can't afford to crash into cars or buildings or you waste time getting on the road again. However, once you've caught up with your suspect, you are given more time. Your car is also equipped with turbo boosts, which you can use to gain extra speed if you are way behind the criminal. Each arrest is based on a "suspicion".</desc>

		<desc>After a nuclear war, the few survivors entered an underground tunnel network below the city of Cholo, waiting for the day when radiation has faded to a safe level. However, because the radiation was higher than anticipated, the computer malfunctioned, keeping people underground. It is your job to send a group of robot droids above the surface to disable the system. You have a first-person view of the robot currently under control. You start with a RAT Droid named Rizzo, but can find and gain control of others including air droids. When you find the computer room you can connect your droid to the terminal and run programs such as the Pass1Txt password list for other robots. Watch out for the robot guards who shoot at you - try to find weaponry of your own. Only a small area of Cholo is inhabitable, so listen out for Geiger Counter clicks as you get close to the wasteland areas - these will weaken your droid. A map is provided, which also indicates where the teleporters are.</desc>

He sprouted like a bad seed in the temple of Shaolin, whose walls lodged the best fighters of all times. The destiny has decided that the last hour for the good has arrived, because the yellow devil seized the original manuscript where Cheng Heung wrote the art of the Choy Lee Fut. Supported on the force of the five magical animals, the speed and the technique of a good apprentice, we will cross the temple of Shaolin until finding the monster and recovering the scroll. We are expert in punches, we handle the sabre with ferocity and make the flexible lance more penetrating and versatile. And all thanks to the Chi. As first action, we will have the possibility of training with the Dummies (the wood men), where we will practice the distance, the speed and the use of complementary techniques. From which we will get up ourselves into the dynamics of the fight and the confrontations hand-to-hand with the partisans of the evildoer. The movements are varied, all of them based on the Fung-Fu techniques. With different arms we will be able to execute different movements using the same keys. Everything depends on the animal that our personage will adopt. The graphical theme also changes according to the fight scenes, including the face of the old man that observes us.</desc>

		<desc>In the game you play Hen House Harry who has to collect 12 (a dozen) eggs from each level, while avoiding the ducklings. The levels each occupy a single screen, and are made up of platforms, ladders and lifts (or elevators), and are thus similar to those in classic platform game Donkey Kong. Corn can also be collected, which stops the time limit from ticking down and also stops the bonus, collected when the level is completed, from decreasing. The ducklings also eat the corn, however. There are only 8 distinct levels. The ninth level is a copy of level 1, the tenth is a copy of level 2, and so on. However, on the second time around the ducklings that can use the platforms and ladders are replaced by the Mother Duck, who can fly around the level going through the platforms and ladders. On the third time around, you have to face both the Mother Duck and the ducklings, and similarly on subsequent goes round, when there are more ducklings.</desc>

Whereas the original game features eight levels of one screen each, this features many more screens arranged into a maze for you to explore. In the game, Hen House Harry must build a giant chocolate egg, with the ingredients (cocoa, milk and sugar), that are found in the factory. Eight of each must be included. Also, the eight parts of a toy kit must be found, to place inside the egg. In order to get all the items you must find your way around the factory, avoiding many types of enemy, and solving puzzles using various items that you can carry. There are a number of ways to get around the factory, including the platforms of the original, but also ropes and pipes, among other things. Despite the drastic changes from the original, the game still retains the sound effects from the original.</desc>

		<name>Cisco Heat: All American Police Car Race</name>
		<desc>In this racing game, the players get to race in police cars instead of the usual racing cars driven by speed freaks (like in the Crazy Cars series). Break the law instead of upholding it, while racing through the streets of San Francisco (Cisco for short, hence the name). Take in the Golden gate Bridge, China Town and the Twin Peaks. Avoid collisions with trams, other cars (driven by annoying citizens), buildings and road blockades etc., while trying to reach the next checkpoint before the time runs out! Use your horn to alert other road-users of your presence.</desc>

You play Mat, at the helm of the USS Centurion prototype fighter, and have the task for saving the world. The game's basic space combat component is fast and smooth, with raging battles resembling Star Raiders. However, in addition to this you must plan your course carefully, both during and between fights. You also have the option of taking on command duties, directing all the other ships in the force.</desc>

		<path>./Collapse (Europe).zip</path>
		<name>Collapse</name>
		<desc>Collapse is a simple puzzle game where players control Zen the Mole who is presented with a network of sticks that he must turn blue. Zen does this by simply walking over them while he is yellow. To get to the network, he must turn himself red so that he can build bridges that lead to it. Zen's redness disappears after a few seconds and he turns back to his default state. Once Zen has managed to turn the sticks blue, he can unleash the Rotox, a white line that moves around adjacent blue sticks, destroying them once the Rotox makes contact. When all the sticks have been destroyed, Zen proceeds to the next screen. The blue sticks must be destroyed within a time limit. While the player navigates Zen around the screen, two creatures walk around the screen, trying to make Zen's task difficult. Contact with either of these creatures result in Zen losing 100 units of time. To deal with them, Zen is equipped with some magic dust that he can sprinkle on them to make them disappear and resurrect in their same position that they appear. Extra time is awarded to Zen by collecting jewels that occasionally appear on screen.</desc>

		<name>Colony</name>
		<desc>Mankind has established a distant colony, but the area is infested with ants, ladybirds and other parasites, all ready to cut through the perimeter fencing and eat your people's food. As a service droid it is your job to prevent this, and maximise the output. Achieving this involves a lot of planning and resource management. There are several buildings at your disposal, containing seeds, solar panels, weaponry, fencing and traps. You must plant the seeds, use the solar panels to maximise their growth, and then harvest the finished product so as to trade it. You can carry a gun to take care of the bugs, but this needs recharging frequently, and the location of the munitions store must be determined. When the bugs break part of the fence, you need to replace it to stop lots more coming through. This can be done more quickly by reducing the compound size, which causes the trade-off loss of growing room.</desc>

Some are wandering around in the open, while others have picked out hiding places, which you must approach from certain angles. Trees, rivers and bridges create a varied combat-like terrain and must be incorporated into your thinking. Extra grenades can be collected, and will definitely be required, as they allow you to kill form distance and thus avoid some enemy shots.</desc>

		<path>./Computer Scrabble (Europe).zip</path>
		<name>Computer Scrabble</name>
		<desc>Computer Scrabble is the earliest official computer version of the popular word game. The game has an 11000-word dictionary containing the most frequently-used words in Scrabble. As a result, some very obscure words (mostly of 2 and 3 letters - keen Scrabble players will know that these are often the most profitable scoring method) are included, but common words such as 'bigot' and 'sheen' are queried by the game - simply tell it that your move is a word and it will move on trustingly. Inputting words is done by moving the cursor across or down to the starting position of the word, and then pressing to key the word in, pressing space before the letter you wish to use a blank tile as. All words formed are accurately scored. The game can juggle your tiles and allow you to manually rearrange them, and you can watch the computer 'think' as it notices possible moves and their scoring. There are four difficulty levels, with the highest capable of combined scores over 700.</desc>

		<desc>This is a puzzle game where you must explode all of the bombs on each level, using a spark. The spark flows along a fuse, which is made up of a series of tiles. These can be moved, in the manner of sliding puzzles, where there is only one gap, and tiles can be moved into the gap, creating a new gap. The aim is then to move the tiles so the fuse forms a path from the spark to each bomb. There is a time limit, however, and extra time is knocked off if the spark reaches a dead end. Also some levels contain water droplets, that extinguish the spark if they touch it.</desc>

		<desc>Three star stones have been hidden in locked treasure chests within a castle inhabited by dragons, guards, spiders, tarantulas wizards and the like. Battle Hero Redham is brave enough to take on such a task, and it is only by obtaining these that he can rescue Taleria. Although Redham is armed with a small supply of daggers (more can be collected), these can only be fired while he is stationary, and the graphics are drawn large so that not much is seen on each screen. This means that a lot of advance route-planning is required, although most creatures can be killed by landing on their heads (horizontal contact with them is however fatal). The tarantulas are perhaps the deadliest foe, as they move so quickly. Treasure chests are located along the route, containing various potions and poisons as well as extra weapons.</desc>

The first race is in Brazil and features 100 cars, and requires you to finish in the top 80 in order to qualify for next race. As you work through the 8 races the size of the field steadily decreases, but so does the worst acceptable finishing position to qualify. The car has high and low gears, and is susceptible to damage from contact with another car. Once you hit a car or a piece of the trackside scenery you will be called into the pits - fail to make it back, or hit another car, and you will crash and lose several seconds.</desc>

Some of them will use all kind of deadly weapons, such as the famous saber or a blunderbuss. Luckily for us and unfortunately for them, our protagonist is quite capable when it comes to fight with punches and kicks. So if all goes well, you will find a small boat which is awaiting you at the other extreme of the island. The second part, to which we can access without the need of finishing the first one, takes place in a pirate galleon. There we will have to represent the role of the hero once again and we should try to rescue the beautiful damsel. Now the game system is quite different from the first part, because we will be no longer able to directly blow our enemies, but we will have to use a sword to finish with all of them. The objective consists in ascending to the pirate flags which are in the different masts of the ship and, in the end, to arrive where the girl is before she ends being food for sharks.</desc>

		<name>Countdown</name>
		<desc>Countdown is a Channel 4 TV show which has continued into the 2010s, despite the death of original host Richard Whiteley in 2005. It's a words-and-numbers game show, and the original format of 6 letters games, 2 numbers games and a conundrum, is recreated here. There is no computer opponent, so 2 people are required. In the letters round, a selection of 9 letters is formed by alternately choosing a vowel or consonant, and the players have 30 seconds to find the longest available word. Generated letter combinations are not always realistic with the show. As in Computer Scrabble, the full dictionary is not stored in memory, so the game will ask if the words you enter are real. The longest word scores its length, with 18 points for a 9 letter word - both players score for equal length words. The numbers game also takes 30 seconds, and involves choosing 6 numbers from a set including 25,50,75 and 100 as well as 2 each from 1-10. Choose how many large numbers you want, and the set is chosen randomly. A three-figure target is randomly generated, and you have 30 seconds to add, subtract, multiply and divide to get as close to it as possible. The conundrum finishes the show - it's a 9-letter anagram, which the first player to solve buzzes in to give his answer, scoring 10 points if correct.</desc>

This takes in several parts of the USA, in several powerful cars. Initially you have a Porsche 911 Turbo in your hands, but this can later be upgraded to a Lamborghini and then a Ferrari. There are other cars on the road, which you must avoid contact with. Bumps and divots in the road throws the car off course, as does contact with any of the roadside barriers. Each race must be completed within the time limit.</desc>

		<name>Crazy Golf</name>
		<desc>Nine holes of chaotic top-viewed ricochets and hazards make up this early Crazy Golf game. They can be skipped for a score of 12 if you get stuck. There are no moving hazards, so gameplay is essentially a golf-themed precise positioning puzzle. Furthering this aspect, it does not matter what pace the ball it at when it reaches the hole (it never rebounds out of it) and that rebounds are always at precise 90-degree angles without taking pace out of the ball. Sixteen shot angles and sixteen shot paces are available. The first hole is simply a row of vertically-placed barriers with only small gaps at each end, but later holes include randomly-placed ball-sized blocks, curved barriers almost enclosing the hole, and square blockades leaving only narrow corridors to play (bounce, more effectively) the ball through. The final hole combines all these for a par-12 challenge.</desc>

		<name>Cyberball</name>
		<desc>After American Football players started cheating by using bionic parts, the game was forced to change its rules. By 2022, the game was played not by humans, but two teams of seven robots. To spice things up, the usual pig skin ball was replaced with a 350 pound bomb. Cyberball brings this fast and furious action to life. Gameplay is essentially the same as the real sport, although the 'downs' are replaced by the bomb's heat gradually increasing towards 'critical'. After this it will explode and possession will be swapped. This is prevented when you cross the 50-yard line, lose possession or score a touchdown, in which cases it resets to 'cool'. Field goals and punts are not featured - the only kick is the initial kick-off you receive. Control passes from the quarterback (thrower) to the intended catcher as soon as a pass is released. The two-player game is co-operative - on offense one player passes and the other receives</desc>

You start the game with nine ships, and more can be earned by collecting enough points during the game.</desc>

		<name>Cylu</name>
		<desc>If you are to be honored with the leadership of the Ostan race, you must explore a virtual reality world, collect the 24 objects which have been hidden within, and bring them all back to the base. Cylu is viewed isometrically, and primarily consists of solving puzzles along the lines of many Ultimate Play the Game titles. Only five objects can be carried at a time, which means the route involves a lot of back-tracking. This is slightly lessened once you find some of the teleport bays, and the key to operate them. There are 32 numbered forcefields around the game, and these must be deactivated by finding the appropriate silicon chip. Your droid requires regular re-fueling, either from canisters located in the early sections of the game, or from the RFL unit you can pick up later.</desc>

		<desc>One of the earliest person-licensed computer games, Olympic legend Daley Thompson lent his name to an old-style joystick waggling frenzy. Ten events were featured, including long and high jumps as well as the predictable sprints, which made for some gameplay variety. You have 3 lives, and lose one every time you fail at an event, which you usually get 3 attempts at. For each event you see both the qualifying time and the world record, which gives you something to aim at.</desc>

		<desc>The third licensed game based around the legendary British decathlete did something slightly wider in scope than the basic Games style of play. Before you play the main events you have to train in the gym. Weight-lifting, squats and sit-ups are included, which involve waggling the joystick as fast as you can to fill a displayed bottle of Lucozade (clever bit of product-placement there). The better you do at this, the better you'll fare in the events, which are predominantly waggling-based as well. They include the standard decathlon events of running, jumping and throwing as well as you can. There are four types of shoes available, and choosing the wrong one for the event will seriously hamper your performance.</desc>

		<name>Daley Thompson's Super-Test</name>
		<desc>Ten sporting events (twelve on the 128K Spectrum version) are recreated in the second game licensed around the Decathlon champion. Each one has its own world record, and a target time / distance / score to reach - fail and you lose one of your three lives. After completing all events successfully they repeat with tougher targets. Rowing, 100m and cycling are pure tests of joystick waggling, and this is a feature of may other events. The penalty shoot-out involves timing the run-up then pressing fire to set the angle of the shot. In the ski-jump, timing the launch and landing are crucial. The tug of war involves choosing a candidate you feel you can beat and then out-waggling them. In the triple jump you must run to the line before holding down fire for the right length of time for each of the 3 phases of the jump (45 degrees is optimal). The hurdles event involves running to and pressing fire to clear the hurdles. Pistol shooting gives you limited time to correctly move a sight into position, before firing as close to the centre as possible. This is made harder by only being able to move up and towards the target, which prevents being able to correct over-movement.</desc>

		<desc>A licensed game based around the cult comic strip character, recreating his daring attempts to defeat Mekon and save the earth. The Anastasia ship is attacked by the Treens as soon as Dan steps onto it, although fortunately he picks up a laser on board. From then on, he must act as fast as possible. The main task is to find each of the 5 parts of a planetary-destruction mechanism to the control room, so that it can be safely diffused. He can only carry one at a time, and once he gets the back he must find the correct socket for each one. Lastly he must escape to the surface. Contact with a Treen will see Dan kidnapped and placed in the prison area; he can get out easily enough, but will now be in a different place. Getting hit by gun blasts will weaken him gradually.</desc>

		<desc>Although directly licensed to John Palevich's earliest interpretation of top-view dungeon-based slashing, this game's features are closest to Gauntlet, the coin-op it inspired. You play either Sheba or Thor (both are active in a simultaneous 2-player game) as you move through 15 dungeons, with the aim of collecting all the available treasure. If this is done successfully, a code will be granted - put them all together at the end of the game. Foes are released in swarms through a control box. Once all these are dead you must destroy the box, to prevent respawning. The dungeons feature treasure, food (for energy), and spells. Be careful not to destroy these by shooting them. Each spell has a random function - disorientating, paralysing or killing the opponents on screen. Like Gauntlet you are constantly losing energy, however treasure can be traded in for energy.</desc>

The second involves avoiding contact with cats and monkeys, by jumping on the backs of crocodiles.

		<desc>The game's set in the Isles of the Western Sea, where the Lord of the Isles has made a big McCock-Up. He forged the Dark Sceptre to defeat the invading Northlanders, but they seized the Sceptre and absorbed its power, becoming the Lords of the Shadow. The isles are now gripped by evil and ruled by the Sceptre, and the forces of the Isles must find and destroy the Dark Sceptre itself. There are seven teams of warriors roaming the Isles, each indicated by a colour. Umbrarg's Warriors are the Shadow Lords, and are red, while white marks your own team. The five sets of fighters in between should begin the game neutrally, and both you and the Shadow Lords can try to beat or befriend these warriors. As you think fit. Each team is made up of men of various qualities, from Thanes to Thralls. The Thane is the team commander, without whom the entire company will be more readily defeated. A Thrall is a simple underling, a pawn in comparison to other more complex characters like Mystics, Heralds, Savages and Assassins. Each has its own style of headwear, such has crowns, turbans and helmets. You have indirect control over your forces, able to tell them to scan an area for hostile warriors, keep an eye out for them, or carry out various orders. You can follow, protect, threaten or ambush warriors, use spells such as Charm and Petrify (turn to stone), or give or use objects.</desc>

		<name>Dark Side</name>
		<desc>In Driller, the Ketars attempted to blow up the moon Mitral, but you stopped them. Now, they have Energy Collection Devices collectively known as EGOs, and hope to stock them up to use towards the Zephyr One device, and direct its energy at the planet Evath, resulting in a catastrophic radiation overload. Your mission is to beam onto their base on the moon Tricuspid, and destroy the EGOs. Destroying one will buy you more of your limited time. The problem is, many are connected to at least 2 others, and those can immediately regenerate, so you must tackle them in an order in which those with only 1 connection are attacked first. You are inside a space suit, propelled by a Jet Pack with limited fuel, and possess lasers and a shield. Shield energy is limited, but can be recharged through pentagons and rods. In a world viewed through the the Freescape 3D system, you roam the verdant planet of trees, buildings and underground tunnels. Gameplay has more action than Driller. The Freescape world has a third dimension - due to the jetpack you can leave the ground and look down on the view. You can also rotate the angle and make quick U-turns. You must leave the ground to shoot the active part of an ECD, but the jetpack uses energy at a faster rate, so use this feature sparingly. You must avoid Plexors, which weaken your shield, and deflector devices, which can beam you into prison.</desc>

Viewed from your cockpit, you fly the LIAR spacecraft around the galaxy, with the hope of achieving liberation, by destroying all the Evil Lord's main bases. You'll have to fly accurately through hyperspace tunnels, and keep moving so as to avoid enemy fire, ideally destroying enemy spaceports as well as planetary bases. There are plenty of energy dumps along the way, which you'll need to collect in order to be able to reach all 256 sectors. The game is hugely customizable, with almost all controls redefinable, and the speed and power of the enemy variable.</desc>

		<name>Deactivators</name>
		<desc>Deactivators is an arcade-puzzle maze game which puts you in control of a squad of bomb disposal droids. You must pick them up and quickly throw them out of the building to safety - failure to do this costs you a droid and a room (occasionally blocking off other essential rooms). The game's levels have grid-like arrangements with doors, trapdoors and poles, and increase in size as the game goes on. For both these reasons, mapping is essential. Security droids are on patrol, but these can be tricked into falling down holes. A computer room is the hub of your activities - this allows you to use teleports and turn off force fields, via the appropriate circuit boards which are hidden throughout the levels. On later levels the gravity isn't constant and you will find rooms with distorted directional senses, increasing the precision required significantly.</desc>

		<desc>Bandits have overrun Dodge City, determined to escape with the loot. As the sheriff, it's your job to stop them in a game resembling Commando without the military setting. Your character has limited ammo, and can replenish this by walking over dead soldiers. You must also watch your thirst level, and head into the hotel at the top of the screen before it reaches zero. As well as the bandits, their horse regularly crosses the screen and must be avoided. As a bonus, the Spectrum version includes a free game called A-Maze, which is unsurprisingly maze-based.</desc>

		<name>Death Wish 3</name>
		<desc>The actor Charles Bronson played the iconic role of vigilante Paul Kersey in 5 movies where he takes the law into his own hands when he doesn't get justice and criminals get off. This game is based on Death Wish 3 which came out in 1985. A friend of Kersey in New York has been killed and he takes to the streets to help the police lay waste to gangs that are brutalizing and rioting in the city. He has a bulletproof vest that will protect him from several shots and can wield 4 guns: the 475 Wildey Magnum, shotgun, machine gun, and rocket launcher. Avoid shooting grannies on the streets, mean street-walkers and the police who occasionally will help you take out the baddies. If you start shooting policemen, they will turn on you too. The upper half of the screen shows you the side-view of the street or building you are in. The lower half shows your score, high score, injury meter, a scrolling police report so you can know where crime is taking place, a compass direction, a map which will also show you where weapons and bosses are located, and which weapon you are holding and the ammo left. When you enter a building, you can fire out the window for higher points but beware of enemies that may come up behind you.</desc>

		<desc>Deep Strike is set in World War 2, and you form part of a squadron attempting a dangerous mission of destroying a Nazi fuel depot. Your fighter plane is armed with guns; a team of bombers are out there with you, with one always in front. Initially you will face a few planes flying towards you. red planes shoot at you, and later there are black 'suicide planes' which aim to take you down Kamikaze style, and 'Blue Max' planes which are extra-tough. After the first minute or so another challenge is added, in the shape of hills to fly around or over. After this, you reach the bombing zone, in which you guide the bombers behind you and instruct them which sites to bomb. The game is viewed from the cockpit, with displays telling you of how much damage you and the bomber have taken, and whether you are steering in the right direction. A map is build in. The controls can be set in two ways, for 'up' on the joystick either equaling 'move upwards' or 'dive' (as on a real plane).</desc>

		<desc>There's plenty of reflection in this game, in both senses of the word. That's because this strategic puzzler involves using mirrors to direct a beam of light across a succession of 60 screens. Each mirror has 16 different angles it can be set at, each of which will send the beam around the screen in different ways. Before the exit is activated, all the mines on a screen must be cleared by running the beam over them. There are other devices built into the levels, including teleports and random angle-changers, as well as hazards to avoid (they cause the beam to overheat) and droids which go around moving the mirrors' directions.</desc>

		<name>Des Chiffres et des Lettres</name>
		<desc>Des Chiffres et des Lettres ("Numbers and Letters") is a French game show which inspired the similar British programme Countdown. Two players compete in a sequence of rounds challenging language and arithmetic skills. In this version you can turn off either type of rounds, and can have infinite time to think in each round, if you wish. In letters rounds, an array of 9 letters is chosen by each player alternately choosing either a vowel or a consonant, and players must find the longest possible legitimate word. In numbers rounds, an array of face-down numbers (including 25, 50, 75 and 100 as well as 2 each of 1-10) is presented to the player, who chooses the number of 'large' numbers. A target between 101 and 999 is then generated, and players must get as close to this as possible. Additionally, there are mental arithmetic challenge rounds, in which players must solve an equation as quickly as possible.</desc>

		<desc>Disc is a game of fast reflexes and clever thinking. You control one player against the computer or another person. The objective is to finish off your opponents by knocking him off the platforms or by making the platform disappear by hitting the walls behind your opponents. Your weapon is a disc, which you can throw at your opponent or at the walls. The disc will ricochet off the walls, opening a wide range of angles and attacks. You can also try a direct hit at your opponents, as enough of these will eliminate him as well, but be careful - since it gives him a chance to block your disc, thus gain control of it! As you progress through the levels, from Novice, through Disciple, up to a Great Guide, your rivals become tougher, platforms take longer hits to disappear, and there are more discs on the playing field.</desc>

As you play and get winning combinations, you'll have to choose whether to collect or gamble what you've won. After completing the fruit machine game, you'll get the chance to play a dice game where you have to guess if the next throw will be higher or lower than the current one. Dizzy Dice features two game modes. The first one you play as a normal fruit machine. But then there also is the bank mode, where you start with $20 and need to reach $100 to break the first bank. In total there is five banks, each requiring more cash to win. The game is controlled using the keyboard.</desc>

Dizzy sets off to rescue her, braving dragons, rats and alligators along the way. The lands are littered with coins, and as well as completing the main task you should aim to collect as many of these as possible. There are puzzles on most screens, involving collecting objects such as keys, food and water buckets, and using them on doors, flames and such. Unlike the first two game, dialogue boxes between Dizzy and various other characters are included, giving the game a sense of character and humor as well as guiding you through the puzzles somewhat.</desc>

		<desc>Released in the arcades in 1981, Donkey Kong was not only Nintendo's first real smash hit for the company, but marked the introduction for two of their most popular mascots: Mario (originally "Jumpman") and Donkey Kong. Donkey Kong is a platform-action game that has Mario scale four different industrial themed levels (construction zone, cement factory, an elevator-themed level, and removing rivets from girders) in an attempt to save the damsel in distress, Pauline, from the big ape before the timer runs out. Once the rivets are removed from the final level, Donkey Kong falls, and the two lovers are reunited. From there, the levels start over at a higher difficulty. Along the way, Mario must dodge a constant stream of barrels, "living" fireballs, and spring-weights. Although not as powerful as in other future games, Mario can find a hammer which allows him to destroy the barrels and fireballs for a limited amount of time. Additionally, Mario can also find Pauline's hat, purse and umbrella for additional bonus points. Donkey Kong is also notable for being one of the first complete narratives in video game form, told through simplistic cut scenes that advance the story. It should also be noted that in versions of the game for early 1980's consoles, Donkey Kong only used 2-3 of the original levels, with the cement factory usually omitted.</desc>

		<desc>Set in a post-apocalyptic New York, Double Dragon is the story of Billy and Jimmy Lee, twin brothers trained in the fighting style of Sou-Setsu-Ken. Together, they manage a small martial arts training school, teaching their students in self-defense. One day, Billy's girlfriend, Marian, is kidnapped off the street by the "Black Warriors", a savage street gang led by a man named Willy. The Black Warriors demand the Lee brothers disclose their martial arts secrets in exchange for Marian's freedom. The Lee brothers set out on a rescue mission to crush the Black Warriors and save Marian. Using whatever techniques they have at their disposal, from the basic punches and kicks to the invulnerable elbow strike, as well any weapon that comes into their hands, the Lee brothers must pursue the gang through the city slum, industrial area and the forest before reaching their hideout to confront the big boss, Willy.</desc>

		<desc>Zambaquous has done everything to make life hell for the people of Agamen, and as their King Kayus, the time has come to head out to destroy him. This leads to six levels of horizontally-scrolling shoot em up action, although with some vertical movement as well. The thing which sets the game apart from every other horizontally-scrolling shoot em up (except Saint Dragon) is that you are riding on the back of a dragon, called Bahamoot. Both you and the dragon have firepower, and holding down the fire button increases Bahamoots energy bolts ferocity. The dragons tail can be controlled indirectly, and because it is indestructible, it can be used either as a shield, or as a weapon in its own right. There are power-ups to collect by dismounting from the dragon and walking into them. These include fiery breath, bolts shot from Bahamoots tail, homing missiles of sorts, and lightning bolts, with only one ever active at a time. Each level has a time limit.</desc>

Player One controls the character named "Blade" wearing white pants and Player Two controls the character named "Striker" wearing green pants. Players start with the ability to do basic punches, kicks and jumps. Some moves are special like spinning kicks and the ability to charge themselves up with "inner energy" (Qi) by holding the punch button to throw a powerful long-range attack that hits all opponents in front of the player. Players will also come across several power-ups; some are weapons like knives and nunchakus and some recharge a player's health, and yet others add a few seconds to the remaining time.</desc>

A variety of puzzle types with a wide and whimsical supporting cast kept classes of kids debating the correct course of action through an array of different environments, progress through each tracked courtesy of a password system. Some 15 or so years later, the game's developers eventually released a multimedia-enhanced remake of it for modern operating systems.</desc>

This first port includes two adventures: the first is to raid the lair of Singe the Dragon (hence the classic name) and rescuing Princess Daphne, and the second, in a sort of instant sequel of the first chapter, features Dirk trying to escape from the castle, now overrun by the Lizard King and its minions.</desc>

		<desc>Drakkar is an action game where you take the role of Erik, a viking that has been contacted by the gods and was told to to collect the three objects that will let him become the king of his people: the parchment of wisdom, the Caesar laurels and the trophy of war. But he will not face his path disarmed, the gods have given him a shield that will protect him from the Roman arrows. Erik has travelled back in time with a magical drakkar (the ancient viking ship) and has to pass a forest that takes directly to ancient Rome, where there are his goals, but first he must consult the gods (in the game presented in the form of dragons) as the order for collecting the objects varies depending on the game. Our hero is armed with a truncheon and shield that has been given by the gods, but the biggest drawback is that such a weapon (plus the axes that he can get later) serves only to certain enemies, while in other occasions he should just avoid any kind of contact with them. The first group of enemies, namely the ones that can be destroyed, belongs to bats and the Roman soldiers armed with swords, maces or arches. The second group belongs to snakes and rats from the forest, fish in the ponds, the notes to the angels of heaven, which in addition to subtracting energy to Erik, leave him immobilized at the mercy of their enemies, and chandeliers, that although lethal, can just be found in the rooms near the parchment. But not everything was going to be bad for Erik, and so, besides the shield of the gods and axes, he can also recharge part of his energy through pears and fish, succulent delicacies have been distributed for the comprehensive mapping.</desc>

An interesting point of the game is that all the teams are composed by five players: one guard, two forwards and two centers, everyone with the typical characteristics of his position and with the possibility of being controlled at every moment. There are also personal faults, so if anyone of your players gets the fifth one he will be expelled of the court, but that's not all, the game also allows you to request time outs, two for each game period, giving you the possibility of changing the tactics, seeing the game stats, etc.</desc>

		<desc>Druid is an action game inspired by the arcade hit Gauntlet. As the eponymous hero, your job is to destroy four magic skulls hidden over eight levels. The game is presented in a top-down view. The druid walks around the terrain seeking out the staircase that leads to the next level. On the way, he is harassed by hordes of monsters that come out of every direction and attack him, decreasing his health. To defend himself, the druid can use the spells of water, fire or electricity to toss projectiles. However, these magical weapons have limited ammo. The druid also has three other magical spells at his disposal - an invisibility spell which prevents the monsters from automatically approaching him, a golem spell which summons a helpful golem (which can be controlled by a second player), and a skull spell which destroys all on-screen enemies. The druid also carries around keys which open locked doors. But all these have very limited supplies. On his way, the druid finds many shops. Each such shop contains some keys or charges for the druid's spells, but the druid can only pick one item from each shop. The druid can also come across a pentagram on the ground which will restore his lost health.</desc>

		<name>Dun Darach</name>
		<desc>Dun Darach may be the first ever videogame prequel  to Tir Na Nog. As such, it features the warrior Cuchulainn of Muirmethne, in a war against the Conachta. When he and his colleague Loeg meet a beautiful woman named Skar in an inn, they do not suspect that she is a spy, and will kidnap Loeg to the secret city of Dun Darach (the 'Oak Fort' in Celtic). Cuchulainn will not stand for this, and sets off to Dun Darach to rescue him. This will involve secondary quests being completed along the way. The game system is identical to that of Tir Na Nog  a single road of the city is shown at a time, which can be walked along to the left or right. When you come to a junction, the view can be rotated by 90 degree to allow this path to be followed. Gameplay is also similar - sword fights must be won and word-based puzzles solved, although unlike Tir Na Nog you cannot die. Trade and money management plays a bigger part than before - objects can be offered to, sold to and stolen from others, and you get obtain jobs for money. Watch out for Ryde the policeman - if he finds you with stolen goods, everything you are carrying will be taken. You must also speak to people and enter magic rooms to obtain key information.</desc>

		<desc>Dustins life of crime has caught up with him; hes been incarcerated in the high-security WADRAS prison. In this arcade adventure, it is your job to get him out, within three hours. Getting into fight with guards, or spending too long in the restricted areas to the north, incurs a twenty-minute penalty and returns you to the opening room. The task involves avoiding guards and manipulating valuable objects. The prison is split into three horizontal corridors, each with many rooms containing prisoners. The player can often trade objects with these prisoners, or simply beat them up instead. Once outside you can escape into safety, by crossing a ditch and then navigating a harsh rural area. The game is viewed from a forced perspective, which takes on a 3D effect while outdoors in the open.</desc>

		<desc>Conversion of the Capcom arcade to home computers. The player adopts the identity of an ancient Chinese warrior, and riding on horseback has to eliminate all his opponents, mostly infantry and archers. The game uses a lateral scroll and the player can move in all four directions. A novelty is the attack system: when pressing fire the energy of the attack will load up as the warrior moves his spear up and backwards, in order to gain momentum. The more the player can keep fire pressed, the more powerful the attack will be. The game spawned a sequel in the arcades, "Warriors of fate", and is not to be confused with the PSX game of the same title, which is a one-on-one fighting game.</desc>

Like most child-oriented licenses of the day, his first computer outing was a platform game, scrolling vertically and resembling Rainbow Islands, although much simplified. Edd must progress up the levels within the time limit (water will come up to drown him - presumably polluted water through which a duck can't swim), while collecting every star. Bad guys can be stunned by shooting them, which makes them safe to touch, although nothing other than Edd actually dies. The levels are all themed around particular areas of the BBC offices, including a sci-fi set and the weather room.</desc>

		<desc>El Capitán Trueno (Captain Thunder) is the name of a famous Spanish comic book which tells the ongoing story of the eponymous 12th-century hero. This is the first game dealing with the character, released to all of the Spanish-speaking world's most vital computing platforms at the time: ZX Spectrum, Amstrad CPC, MSX and MS-DOS; all ports except for the PC version contain two different segments, the first a calmer adventure portion followed by some frenetic arcade action. The final mission is to rescue Sigrid, Trueno's beloved, from the monastery of his friend Abbot Estanislao de Castiglione. Along the way, the Capitán will have to face giant spiders, skeleton soldiers, enormous rats and a plethora of imaginative creatures such as the Abbot transformed into a demonic goat. The Capitán strives to triumph over all these opponents with the assistance of his friends sturdy Goliath, who though immobile can lash out with meaty fists and jump in place to cause earthquakes, and nimble Crispín, a man who can shimmy up a rope of any length.</desc>

But talking about the game, we are on the XI century, a dark time full of incessant fights between the the good and the evil. A legend whose antiquity was lost in the abyss of the times, assured the existence a parchment that, with being read by the evil forces, would trigger such big wave of disasters that Satan would be able to seize the Earth and assure its dominion as prince of the darkness. Our audacious protagonist, when knowing the legend of the parchment, was decided to recover it for the forces of the good, since the legend also affirmed that if this document would be read by two persons of good intentions, their effects would be annulled for ever. With this objective in mind, he began to search the magical key, that released the spell that had hidden the parchment. But the task was not going to be simple, like him, many horsemen had decided to find the parchment, some with glory anxieties and others by less worthy reasons. Luckily for Rodrigo (el Cid), the many years of fight against the Moors had fortified their noble arm, reason why the combats by sword are no secret for him.</desc>

		<name>Elevator Action</name>
		<desc>You are Agent 17 (codename: "Otto"). Your mission is to secure all top secret documents from a security building and escape in the getaway car, located in the basement of the building. Enemies spies are scattered throughout the 30-floor building and they have only one mission: execute Agent 17 at all costs. There are several ways in which Agent 17 can kill them: 1. Shooting them with his gun. 2. Kicking them by jumping onto them. 3. Shooting a light on the ceiling while in an elevator, dropping the light onto one of them. 4. Crushing them with an elevator. Whenever a light has been dropped, the hallways will be dark for a short period of time, making the enemy spies harder to see. The same holds true for hallways that are already dark. While Otto is in an elevator, he will have complete control of it by moving up or down. Agent 17 can still get killed if he's already in an elevator if a bullet's trajectory is aimed at it.. When Otto is not in an elevator, it will move from floor to floor automatically, even when enemy spies are in it. Otto is able to leap over the elevator gaps, but he must be as close to the edge as possible without falling off in order to make the jump safely. If there is an elevator cable in the way, however, it will block him, causing him to fall. Just because the game is called Elevator Action doesn't mean that elevators are the only means of travel. There are also escalators which you can ride up or down, useful if you want to avoid gunfire and don't have time to jump. Otto must go into the rooms with red doors to collect the top secret documents. If he tries to get to his car without getting all the documents, he cannot escape and must go back and collect the remaining documents. Once he has all the documents and drives away, he then proceeds to the next building. If Otto takes too much time to collect the documents, the alarm will go off, and he will have trouble controlling the elevators, which will take time to react. Bad guys will be especially aggressive. The alarm doesn't go off when Otto loses a life, it only resets after finishing a building. Besides ducking, bad guys may also drop themselves and lay flat on the floor. It's virtually impossible for Otto to shoot bad guys when they do this. Also, Otto cannot duck when in an elevator.</desc>

		<desc>A shoot em up set on a patchwork-quilt coloured road, Eliminator puts you in control of a ship with a basic weapon, flying along at breakneck speed. There are barriers along the way to avoid, often set in quick succession, and lots of bad guys to shoot at or avoid - their shots must be avoided too. Some parts of the track are blocked unless you can shoot through obstacles before reaching them, or hit a jump pad. At some points you can change to travelling along the ceiling as well. Tokens can be collected en route, and used to obtain better weapons, but losing a life costs you the best one youve currently got.</desc>

		<desc>You have a ship with virtually no equipment. Take her and trade among the different star systems. You can be safe and trade on razor-thin margins among the safe systems, or take some risks and trade with anarchic systems while watching out for pirates. You can save on fuel costs by buying a fuel scoop and fly near the sun, but again, watch out for pirates! Or be a pirate yourself and raid other ships... Don't get a bad rep as the police will come after you... Dock with space stations and do your trades (some may take contraband...) Upgrade your ship with your proceeds with better weapons, shields, and other equipment. With 8 different galaxies, each with HUNDREDS of planets, there are plenty of room for exploration! Can you make your reputation all the way up to "elite"?</desc>

Player skill levels and fitness levels vary, so picking the right team is just as important as the way you control your players during the game. Fixture lists, results, and league tables may be displayed at any time during the season, and if you have a Commodore or compatible printer you can even print them out as a permanent record.</desc>

		<name>Endurance</name>
		<desc>Endurance uses the same basic game system as CRL's Formula One, but turns its attention to motorcycle racing. As the title suggests, the six races featured are all lengthy, and include two 24-hour races for your two bikes (each with 2 riders assigned to it) to complete. Before each race you must set the bike up, trading off speed, fuel consumption and safety for the engine, and speed, safety and tyre wear for the chassis; you must also choose one of the 3 tire compounds. Options are selected using a menu-based system, mostly by clicking on words. Races are depicted via a side-view of the bikes scrolling past the pit straight, with constant updates as to the race leader and any bike problems. You can instruct your riders as to how aggressively to race, and must call your bikes in for pitstops to refuel, change tyres and swap riders. As in the previous game these are controlled in real-time by moving the mechanic around.</desc>

		<name>Enduro Racer</name>
		<desc>In this game you play the role of an endurance bike racer. The gameplay involves you racing against the clock to get to the finish line and jumping over ramps. At the end of each race you get points for how many cars or bikes you have overtaken with which you can upgrade your bike. There are various different terrain for you to race on including desert beach and dirt tracks plus a number of things to slow you down or even knock you off of your bike all together. The main idea is to find the best route through each level to shave off valuable seconds in order to over take more cars and bikes. The Japanese version of the game has more Tracks than the European and US versions have. Among them is a snow track which is one of the hardest tracks in the game, because there is a lot of stones on the thin road.</desc>

		<desc>Sury Ani 7 has been a source of mined resources for many a year, but now that it is contaminated, the only way to harvest its bounty is to do so remotely. Worse still, the security system of defence droids is active, and primed to damage anything which attempts to penetrate the surface. As such, you are in control of a Dedicated Disposal Droid in, which must eventually shut down the security system and clear the area of radioactive material. This is done by throwing it down the disposal chute on each of the 8 levels, but you only have limited time before they explode. Fuel is limited and must be found within the complex, with the retro-thrust move using it up particularly quickly. To reach the next level you must find the appropriate pass.</desc>

ESWAT: Cyber Police is a horizontal-scrolling beat 'em up where you have to make your way from left to right and defeat a mastermind. There are 15 stages to complete, and have you patrolling through Liberty streets, car yards, stadiums, restaurants, the CBD, construction sites, and boat docks. While you're out on patrol, you can pick up ammunition, and the amount you get varies. For example, on some levels, ammo may be worth 10 bullets, while in others, you may get 60 bullets. Once you have obtained the cyber-suit, you wear it for the duration of the game.</desc>

		<name>Exolon</name>
		<desc>This action game combines shoot 'em up and platform elements, as you control a flying man who can gain an exoskeletal suit for extra protection (hence the name). Your task is to progress from left to right in each level, either along the ground or by using the arrangement of platforms. Most of the baddies can be avoided rather than shot, and this is often easier, especially as you can duck or jump to avoid them. As well as a standard gun (activated by tapping fire) you also have a limited number of missiles to take out installations (activated by holding down fire, which makes autofire facilities useless). The scrolling is flick-screen, perhaps as the game was designed for the C64, and the Amiga version was identical to the ST's.</desc>

		<desc>After attempting to simulate orienteering with The Forest, Graham Relph takes things a step further by creating a game-world with no fewer than 4 billion locations. These are drawn in considerable detail, and viewable from 2 different modes, as you fly (viewed from above) or walk (viewed panoramically). The task is to locate 9 objects, and you do this by flying close enough to one that a beacon is activated, to which will direct you to it. You must then find a patch of clean land to land on, and then get close by walking to it. Occasionally you will encounter robotic bugs to kill.</desc>

		<desc>Your aim in life is to be the greatest train robber in the Wild West, a multi-stage task recreated in this coin-op conversion. Your character has plenty of attacking kicks and punches to use on anyone who gets in his way, starting with the local banker, and then some coyotes roaming the plains, who are easier dodged than killed. After this, you find yourself atop the train, attacking a succession of guards in one-on-one beat em up duels, each of which must be won outright within the time limit to avoid losing a life. Many of these shoot at you, so dodge their shots as you attack them. The game offers a practice mode, in which you have 32 lives to try to improve your skills, and a normal mode in which you have unlimited continues as long as you can reach the high-score table with each continue  in this mode, as in the advanced mode in which you must always start again from scratch, you have 5 lives</desc>

		<desc>Of all the mundane tasks which've been turned into action-packed games, bug-repelling must be up there with being a Paper Boy or a Trashman. These aren't average bugs; Chicago is under siege from mutated insects, rats and even toy tanks. You'll have to work through seven houses, each of which has the typical rooms. You control a seemingly-dismembered hand, which must deal with the hordes as they come towards it, into the screen. They can be shot, thumped, or squashed depending on their type. To clear a room you must kill a certain number of creatures in each of the vertically-divided 'lanes' of the room - this causes squares on the ground to change colour.</desc>

		<desc>Your task in Extreme essentially involves wiping out alien pirates, across 3 distinct sections. This was essentially a spare-time pet project, so you would expect some of the most advanced graphics and special effects you'll ever see on a Spectrum. The first level involves flying around in a ship shooting out aliens, with contact depleting your energy (and causing the screen border to flash). The second section involves travelling underwater, running into landmines to set off explosions to kill surrounding enemies. The final part sees you travelling through a building in a huge droid, taking out everything in your path. The game is quite short, and would take around 20 minutes to play through.</desc>

Viewed isometrically, Isvar's adventure features complex object manipulation: each object has its own physical properties and resultant characteristics in terms of how much else can be carried alongside it. The castle is guarded and full of trolls, who can weaken Isvar's energy - food and wine can restore it.</desc>

The rightful leaders of the country have called you in to destroy Fernandez's hideouts and bring his country back to the people. Fundamentally this is a Commando clone, scrolling vertically and with hordes of enemies to be taken on, with finding good shielding spots and launching surprise attacks an especially useful strategy.You have unlimited bullets and limited but collectible grenades to use. There are landmines to avoid, and medical packs to pick up. On each of the 8 levels you must destroy Fernandez's buildings, which are accessed through an underground network of tunnels. You're not limited to being on foot - you start off in a jeep and can also use motorbikes, tanks and similar, although losing a life destroys this. In 2-player mode you can split driving and gunning duties. When starting a new game, you always start from the point at which you died in the last game.</desc>

This takes place in a side-view beat 'em up similar to Way of the Exploding Fist. Mythical winged and dog-headed monsters and half-human hybrids are your opponents, fought one at a time. You can duck and jump, and the weapon at your disposal can be used for high, middle and low strikes. Containers offering magical powers (both good and bad) can be found and unlocked. Once inside the temple there are more foes to defeat.</desc>

		<desc>The King of Isbisima has entrusted you, Magic Knight, with the task of getting a present for his daughter. He sends you into the castle of Spiteland, which is overloading with treasures to uncover. Whether you return with them to please the King, or simply flee with everything you can get, is up to you. Either way, the gameplay is platform-based, with enemies floating around to rob you of energy on contact. There are also scrolling mazes to move through. As you collect objects (often by using some of the other items you collect, to create chemical reactions of sorts and adding an element of lateral thinking), you must try to trade them for the most valuable items you can get.</desc>

She is being held in the eighth chamber, but to reach her, you must navigate a series of tunnels that are being patrolled by the scorpions, and use objects scattered throughout the chambers to proceed to the next one. These objects include getting keys that will open yellow doors, and explosives that will detonate walls. Objects placed at the proper locations usually cause a chain reaction that clears the obstacles. Occasionally, scorpions are seen laying eggs, and getting these eggs will award you with bonus points. When the queen ant is rescued, the game resets to the first chamber.</desc>

		<desc>A girl is trapped on the top floor of 16 burning skyscrapers, and as a firefighter, your mission is to climb up these skyscrapers and put out the flames that shoot through the building's windows, threatening every single floor. You'll also rescue other people trapped inside. Your mission becomes difficult by falling objects and fireballs, and even the flames shoot sparks in any direction at any time. You can use the water spray on the flames to distinguish them. Doing so will occasionally reveal cash and other special items, which include: the 3-way water spray, which allow you to extinguish flames north, east, and west of you; invincibility, to make you invincible for a few seconds; and speed, which boosts you up several floors. You start the game with four lives. You'll lose any one of these lives by coming in contact with fire and falling objects, running out of time before rescuing the girl, or getting the speed power-up when you are near the top of the building.</desc>

		<desc>A Flunky is a male servant who must do routine jobs for his masters; in this game you are a Flunky and your masters are the British Royal Family. There are five tasks to be undertaken  light all the fires, fetching a toy boat from the bath for Prince Andrew, some freckles for Fergie, a wig for Diana, and a mystery task for the Queen. To gain access to each room, you need the signatures of particular royals along the way. Flunky is an arcade adventure using the same game system as other Don Priestley's Trapdoor license  large sprites overlaid onto block objects, seemingly designed around Spectrum attribute-clash issues. Many screens operate on more than 1 horizontal plane, so you can move your character in and out of the screens as well as across them. Guards will shoot at you if you attempt to access restricted areas, so be careful.</desc>

		<desc>The football management game style has been one of the most enduring since Kevin Toms pioneered it in 1982. You start in the 4th division with the team of your choice, and can play on indefinitely in the hope of reaching the top division and dominating it, as well as winning the cups. Players can be bought or sold, with their transfer values varying according to the size of any bid. Their skills and morale vary as the season goes on, with resting key players in easy matches often a key move. You can take out a loan, limited depending on your division, while day-to-day bills must be covered. Matches feature short animated highlights sequences of key moments.</desc>

		<name>Football Manager 2</name>
		<desc>Football Manager from Addictive was the first game of its kind, and this sequel followed several years later, absorbing ideas from the many similar games released in between. Teams can now choose formations, and assign man-to-man marking. Players have individual skills and fitness ratings, in a more realistic way, with half-time substitutions and tactical changes supported. The whole 92-club league is incorporated, as is the League Cup alongside the FA Cup. It is now possible to watch and assess the individual performance of the players, with match graphics differentiating the attack / midfield / defense areas more clearly. Training allows passing length and height to be specified.</desc>

		<name>Football Manager 3</name>
		<desc>Football Manager 3 is a managerial simulation in which the player is responsible for the athletic success of a soccer team in Great Britain. The game is controlled via menus which are reached by clicking on graphics in a visualized office. The focus lies on the athletic aspect, e.g. tactics, training (can be set separately for each athlete ) or lineup, the financial aspect is mostly restricted to buying and selling athletes on the transfer market. Of course each athlete has a number of statistics associated which influence his performance on the field. The matches are shown in one of two two non-scrolling perspectives, either top-down or slightly angled from the side, on which relatively small player icons do their work.</desc>

		<desc>Footballer of the Year sees you taking total control of the career of an aspiring striker with a Division 4 team, with the Footballer of the Year award the ultimate goal. You start with a small amount of money, which is used to buy goal cards; each of these sets you up a chance in a match. Up to three can be played in each game, making Hat-Tricks a possibility. The action sequences involve studying a move plan on the chalkboard, then getting into the right position to execute the final shot. Fail to score enough goals and you may lose your place in the team; do especially well and you may gain a transfer up the league.</desc>

		<name>Footballer of the Year 2</name>
		<desc>Fed up with football (soccer) management games, with all the match strategies, financial turmoil and prima donna players? This game offers a unique twist, leaving you 'managing' the career of a single player, involving matches and transfers. You start with 10 'goal cards' - up to 3 can be played in each match, each of them giving you a shooting chance, at which point arcade action skill comes in. The better you perform, the higher your wages are, the more chance you have of a big-money transfer and international call-up, and the less chance you have of being dropped from the team. There's also a trivia section, which asks increasingly difficult questions allowing you to go double or nothing on knowing the answers - up to £8000 a time can be won on this.</desc>

This can be done in wet or dry, and with manual or automatic gears. Expect to have to drive realistically in terms of braking points and acceleration levels to set a quality lap.

		<name>Formula One</name>
		<desc>Shortly after Football Manager became a sensation, the sports management concept was applied to the high-pressure dollar-intensive world of Formula 1 racing. The top six teams of the early 80s are featured (Ferrari, Williams, Renault and McLaren as well as the now-defunct Brabham and Lotus), and you can choose which one to manage. Your first tasks are to choose your two sponsors and two drivers, with all the day's top names as well as 6 'rookie' drivers, who are cheap, but there's no guarantee of getting a good one. Once the game is properly underway, you must buy engine and chassis upgrades, and can improve the quality of your pitcrew - all of which eats into your budget. Your cars must be raceworthy to be able to race. After qualifying you must choose your tyres for each car - rain can be a factor, and the game informs you of the expected conditions before the race. The races are depicted via a timing board which displays the top 6 in the order, images of the cars flashing by (with a distinction made as cars come into the pits), and messages detailing crashes, spins and technical problems. Your drivers can be called in for pitstops, which involves moving a man around to undo each tyre in sequence, which is hardly realistic but does add some arcade skill and variation.</desc>

		<desc>Former boxing World Champion Frank Bruno, famed for his catchphrase "you know what I mean, Harry?" and more recently his heroic battle with depression, put his name to this boxing game which replicates Punch-Out. As Frank, you must take on 8 progressively tough boxers to win the title. The action is viewed from right behind Frank in 3D, meaning that you can see and feel the full impact of punches. A full range of moves is provided, with the standard jabs complimented by body punches and the ability to dodge, duck or raise your guard. Each punch weakens your opponent's strength, although going long enough without being hit can see this begin to recover. A rain of blows can produce a quick knockout, but in general you must hit him many times, and then with a knockout blow, to see him go down.</desc>

Enemies moving around on preset paths include spiders, tanks and lobsters. Once all parts are connected Frank must activate the switch on the monster's case.

After discovering a gruesome murder, your interest in something greater than the routine of 80s Liverpool is awoken. You explore the streets and houses in the search of a way out. The main basis of the game involves picking up objects and using them in the correct way - most objects have more than one potential use, and misusing them is the only way the game can be lost.

After one of his last "little" parties he decided to take the controls of his spaceship in not very appropriated conditions to pilot, so our sidereal playboy went to play with meteorites under the effects of drunkenness. Evidently this diversion could not have finished very well, he crashed with a meteorite, lost the control of his spaceship and fell with it to planet Ternat's moon, where it's located the enemy base of Kaldar. Injured and laughing, he managed to left the smoky spaceship and slowly noticed that in such a place he wouldn't be received in a very friendly way. Already recovered of his dunk, Freddy Hardest, who although could not look it, is one of the most intelligent members of the Sidereal Free Planet Confederation's SPEA Agency Service of Counterespionage, he must start the adventure.</desc>

You must navigate your way through planet Cosmica, and rescue your brethren, within the limited 'Twang' energy you have. Cosmica is full of hideous monsters, many of which can be shot. Your character builds momentum as it moves, so some hazards are easier to clear from a running start. You can only jump vertically, although you have control as the character falls. Ammunition is limited, and must be collected throughout your quest. Three sweets which enhance your character can be collected - the red one increases your speed, blue increases the height of your leap, and green means you can safely fall further. There are additional objects to pick up and use as well.</desc>

		<desc>You control Fruity Frank as he tries to harvest all of the fruits on the screen. However, there are numerous bad guys out to get him! Frank can defend himself from the bad guys in two ways: he can push the apples located throughout the play field on top of the enemies and crush them or Frank can use his power ball. This ball can be thrown at an enemy to destroy it. He has only one power ball, though, so he will need to wait for it to return to him before it can be used again. When you successfully collect all of the cherries, you will move on to the next and more challenging level. This game is very similar to the first Mr. Do! game except that in Fruity Frank you don't collect letters from the alphabet.</desc>

		<desc>As rebel forces close in on the space station Gallion, you launch strikes against enemy-controlled planets in the most sophisticated techno-toy available to mankind, the space fighter Thunder Cloud II. The game is a blend of action sequences in an Afterburner-esque pseudo-3D view. These sequences vary between ground combat, aerial combat and space combat, with different motion physics and enemy craft. There is also a strategic battle choices on a galactic map invaded in real-time. The PC version uses speaker tweaks to recreate the game's tune on theoretically-inferior hardware.</desc>

		<desc>After nuclear wars of the past, the planet Galletron has been isolated for many years, but it's now visible again, and still a beautiful place. If the Aarls take charge of it, the results for nearby planets could be catastrophic, so the Federation of Interplanetary Trustees (FIT) have send you in to ensure this doesn't happen. First you must head to 9 nearby planets and destroy their sophisticated communications systems (the Aarls have technology to beam solid matter around the universe), before heading for Galletron itself. You have two distinct guns, one for destroying enemies and one for destroying locked security doors. Use of these drains the ship's energy, which can be replenished by picking up tokens. Control is by rotating the ship and then thrusting it forward or backwards.</desc>

All the power of Gremla rested in the almost religious fidelity of her lieutenant Arkos; nevertheless, the intelligence of this Mega-Terminator of battle had evolved on the last ultraguarks in such a way that, finally, he left Gremla and he was united to the troops of the sidereal infantry, who commanded the general of the blue star Mc Killer. As far as the game in itself, it's frenetic arcade divided in two parts, in which when it stops to arrive at second, you needed a key access that you obtained at the end of first.</desc>

		<name>Garfield : Big, Fat, Hairy Deal</name>
		<desc>In the earliest licensed entertainment videogame of Jim Davis' lazy cat cartoon character, you play Garfield in his attempt to rescue Arlene from the cat pound. The primary gameplay involves object manipulation, gaining objects either by picking up or receiving them from other characters (usually in exchange for other objects). Most characters from the cartoons play a part in the game. Odie the dog follows you around - swipe him for points. Garfield's cousin Nermal can help you out. They can also carry objects for Garfield's use. Garfield needs regular food and rest - without one of these he falls asleep and it is Game Over. Contact with many foes is draining. A butcher's is one major food source.</desc>

		<name>Garfield : Winter's Tail</name>
		<desc>After a fruitful day spent on his favorite hobby (food, what else?), Garfield the cat falls asleep next to Jon's still open fridge. The chill coming out of the refrigerator induces a dream of the Swiss Alps, with Garfield going after the largest lasagna factory in the world and a mythical chicken that can lay chocolate eggs. It is the player's goal to make sure Garfield's dream comes to a happy ending before he wakes up. Garfield: Winter's Tail comprises of three different mini-games.The first one has Garfield skiing downhill towards a ski-jump that will lead him straight to the rooftop of the lasagna factory. The second mini-game is set in the chocolate factory where the mythical chicken is employed: Garfield must ensure all the mechanical chickens in the factory are provided their chocolate supply flowing through a pipeline. Finally, he must ice-skate across a frozen lake, following the trail of chocolate footsteps left by the chicken. As a disturbing element, Odie appears throughout the whole game. The drooling dog can steal some of the food Garfield needs to replenish his energy, but he can also tamper with the lift controls in the factory and saw holes in the frozen lake. The three mini-games can be played in any order. However, playing the whole game from the skiing level first is the only way to be able to see the ending.</desc>

		<desc>Gauntlet, the original arcade smash hit, is a fighting game where you choose a character and let rip into the hordes of enemies that assault you on you way to the end of the level. One or two players must make their way through 100 levels of mayhem and magic. It featured a choice of four characters to play with, each with different weapons. Thor the Warrior, has a bludgeoning battle axe, Thyra the Valkyrie, has a close range sword, Questor the Elf has his long range bow, and Merlin the Wizard has magical bolts. Ghosts, goblins and even the life draining Death are your enemies. Enemies stream out of generators, so destroy these before tackling the rest. Keys are needed to open the many doors within the levels, and in some situations a door will contain only bonus items, not a progressive route. Scattered magic potions act like smart bombs and clear the screen of all enemies. Beware of poison though, this reduces your energy level. Treasure is abundant throughout the levels and adds to your score.</desc>

		<name>Gee Bee Air Rally</name>
		<desc>Gee Bee Air Rally adds another dimension to motor racing - literally, as the action takes place in the sky. It targets the feel of pioneering races between 250mph planes in the valleys of the southern USA between brave but honest goggle-wearing men - a sort of Mille Miglia in the sky. The game consists of 16 courses, which are marked out by giant suspended cones, each of which is to be completed against a time limit, while avoiding contact with the other planes. You must stay within the cones, any time spent outside it results in the alloted time ticking down at a prohibitively fast rate (so don't think of short-cutting the track). After every second successful race, you take on a bonus track, in which balloons must be hit for points.</desc>

		<name>Genghis Khan</name>
		<desc>Genghis Khan is basically a strategy game, but not just. A very important part of your ability as governor will depend on your arcade experience when it comes to conquering the territories surrounding Mongolia. You mission will be to invade the Chinese Empire, and for that you must tear down the Great Wall using gunpowder. Unfortunately it will not be available from the beginning, so you will have to conquer Baghdad where the secrets of gunpowder manufacture are kept, and then dedicate your task in destroying the barrier that prevents you from the victory. But it will not be that easy, you will also have to defeat several enemies of varying difficulty. The game makes you choose between arcade, strategy or a mixture of both. In the first category you must use the joystick to defeat the owner of the chosen land. The screen turns into a side-scrolling game in which a Mongol warrior, sword in hand, must face the enemy hordes. Each soldier you kill equalizes to five in total, and every blow you receive means a loss of five units of yours.</desc>

		<desc>At a time when multi-event sports simulations where all the rage, Martech produced one licensed by a successful shot-putter and strongman. There are six events on offer, which represent standard strongman tasks such as truck-pulling, a tug of war and wrestling. Each must be completed within a time limit; points are awarded based on how much time is left. The game's control method and design philosophy distinguishes between each of the 8 main muscles Geoff uses. After a joystick-waggling challenge to raise as much strength as possible, you can choose which muscles to assign it to, which adds an element of strategy and memory-testing. During each event, the 8 muscles are displayed on either side of the screen, and as one comes into use it will flash. Controlling a cursor, you must click on this as quickly as possible to achieve maximum effect. Any energy unused on each muscle is kept over for future events.</desc>

		<name>GFL Championship Football</name>
		<desc>This must be one of the earliest team sport games to use a first-person view  the packaging mocks the Xs and Os used to represent players in contemporary Gridiron games. What you see is what the player sees  control and viewpoint passes from the kicker to the receiver on a punt or kickoff, and the quarterback to the running back or receiver on a pass or kick. Releasing passes involves rotating the controls to select the pass direction. To take the ball, aim the visible hands in the centre of the screen. There are 28 teams split into four divisions; their names are fictional (including the Seagulls, Mustangs and Geronimos), and each is rated out of 3 on 8 areas of skill. Matches last for 4 quarters of either 4 or 7 minutes' in-play time. Menus to select plays or teams involve using diagonal movements for selection. Standard Gridiron rules apply  gain 10 yards in 4 attempts (downs) without fumbling or having a pass intercepted; kick a punt or field goal if you are about to fail at this.</desc>

		<path>./Ghostbusters (Europe).zip</path>
		<name>Ghostbusters</name>
		<desc>Based on the movie of the same name, the Ghostbusters are the ones to call who will "bust" any ghost hauntings. It does this through the use of nuclear accelerated "proton packs" and traps, whereby the ghosts can be captured and transferred to a secure storage facility. However New York City has suddenly become a very haunted place, and the number of ghosts has suddenly increased. The Ghostbusters must reduce the paranormal (PK) level in the city, representing ghost power, before the Temple of Zuul awakens and ressurects an evil goddess, Gozer. Ghostbusters is an action game that combines an overhead view and a side-view. From Ghostbusters HQ, the player must monitor the map of New York City for "ghost alarms" as well as casual spirits, and plot a route to the alarmed area. The player then controls the Ghostbuster vehicle as it drives through traffic. Here, the player is able to capture casual ghosts on the way if they are en route. Once at the location, the game switches to a side-view. Two of the ghostbusters will take position and activate their proton beams and toss a trap to the ground. The player will attempt to maneuver the ghost(s) over the placed trap. Once activated, the trap attempts to capture any ghosts directly above it. Successful capture will earn the player money, which can then be used to purchase new Ghostbusters vehicles and new modifications for the vehicle. Unsuccessful capture will see the ghost fly away. As the game progresses, the PK energy of the city increases. Ghostbusters must keep it under critical levels by being constantly successful at ghost captures. Eventually the Temple of Zuul will activate, and if the PK levels are still manageable, the Ghostbusters can venture there for a final showdown with Gozer.</desc>

Rival drivers also have their own styles and strengths, and to win the World Championship you will have to master these. Pitstop timing and planning is crucial as well, although only tires are changed in late-1980s F1. Graphics are sprite-based.</desc>

		<desc>Calling it a 'simulator' was a stretch, as with many of Codemasters' titles. In reality it was an overhead-view Super Sprint style arcade racer for 1 or 2 players, similar in many ways to the company's BMX Simulator. There were up to 14 circuits depending on the format, which incorporated many underpasses (some of them deliberately unrealistic) and tight curves. There were oil slicks to avoid and points bonuses to pick up. The cars have slow acceleration but a lot of power down the straights. You are scored based on your overall time and your fastest lap. Lose to the computer car and it's game over.</desc>

		<desc>A sequel to the previous Grand Prix Simulator, a popular Super Sprint style racing game. As before, the action is viewed from overhead across a succession of tracks featuring hairpins, oil slicks and similar hazards. You must complete each race within the time limit; and time left after one race is added to your allowance on the next one. After the race you can view a replay. The two main new features are a 3-player mode (there are always 3 cars present in total) and a damage meter which mean that repeat contract with barriers or other cars hampers your performance.</desc>

		<desc>An indelible memory for the entire '80s cohort of UK schoolchildren, this educational game, originally released in 1983 on the BBC Micro, solicits textual input from the player regarding the correct approach and technique for rescuing three pairs of royal children from a wicked witch. A variety of puzzle types with a wide and whimsical supporting cast kept classes of kids debating the correct course of action through an array of different environments, progress through each tracked courtesy of a password system. Some 15 or so years later, the game's developers eventually released a multimedia-enhanced remake of it for modern operating systems.</desc>

The game scrolls vertically, as you move up the screen shooting enemies, finding good strategic firing points and collecting powerups. As the enemy soldiers come towards you in groups, some care is required when picking them off, either using your gun or the grenades. There are also hostages carried by some soldiers, with points bonuses for not shooting these but shooting their captors. Each level ends with a boss.</desc>

		<desc>Gun.Smoke is a top-down scrolling shooter that casts the gamer as a lone gunman, out to save the gold rush town of Hicksville from a fearsome group of bandits known as the Wingates. Each level has a particular target enemy, although his or her henchmen must also be taken out. Although it largely takes place on foot, the gameplay resembles Commando, with its top-down action. The screen scrolls at a constant rate, and enemies come at you from the edges, to be shot or avoided. You can grab various power-ups along the way. Finding a horse will allow you to get hit twice before you die rather than just once. There are scenes in which you raft up a river and use the tracks of a railway line. On the NES you can tap the A button to fire up and right, the B button to fire up and left, or A and B simultaneously to fire straight ahead. One-button control systems mimic all this.</desc>

You can hit the jesters, kings, queens, and chalices for points and bonuses. Avoid the axemen and monks - the axeman takes your life, and monk returns you to the start of the game/ Different royal members, including monks, increase your score. As such, hitting monks can be a good move if you are confident. On the right of the screen you may see your career progress in the gutter (D/1/2/3/0/S).</desc>

		<name>Gyroscope</name>
		<desc>Releasing a game which resembles a well-known arcade game before any official license can be released was always a challenge for publishers, and in this case Melbourne House released a game similar to Marble Madness. Controlling a gyroscope, you most navigate your way down a sloping track full of hazards. The viewpoint is in fixed isometric 3D, with hazards including buildings, ramps and drops. The gyroscope accelerates quickly and takes time to slow down, so it is easy to go into a screen too fast. Failing to keep the gyroscope spinning freely as it navigates these costs you one of your seven lives. You are also playing within a time limit - losing a life sees you return to the start of a level without regaining lost time, but running out of time sees you lose a life, but be able to continue from where you were left with a new set of time (so, as with Chase HQ, completing tricky levels can take 2 or 3 lives at first). You get time bonuses for completing a screen, points bonuses for completing one of the seven four-screen levels, and an extra life for reaching 1000 points. At the end of level 7, you will get 1000 points for each remaining lives, doubling your current amount of lives. You will then start again at level 1 but mirrored by the vertical axis (you are now climbing from the bottom of screen to the top). After level 14 (level 7 mirror), you will again win 1000 points for each remaining lives and then the game loop on level 1 (not mirrored).</desc>

		<desc>There is trouble in the mines! Volcanic activity has trapped numerous miners, and it is your job to save them. As Roderick Hero, you need to make your way through the dangerous mineshaft avoiding the dangerous creatures and lava, and find out where the miners are located before you run out of energy. To help on your mission, Roderick Hero has several useful types of equipment. A prop pack will allow you to hover and fly around the mineshaft and (hopefully) avoid the many dangers within. Your helmet features a short range microlaser beam which can be used to destroy the bats, spiders, snakes, and other creatures you'll encounter in the mines. From time to time, your path through the mine may be blocked by stone or lava walls. You begin each mission with six sticks of dynamite which can be used to destroy these obstacles (be careful you don't blow yourself up, though!) If you run out of dynamite, your laser beam can also be used to destroy the walls, though this will take longer and use up more energy. As the levels progress, the mine shaft will become longer and more maze-like, creatures will more frequently block the path, and lava walls and pools will appear which are dangerous to the touch.</desc>

You're starting into the adventure as a real hacker would do, lacking information of what is to come, only driven by your ambition. Consequently, the game opens with a plain text screen, prompting you for the login password. To break into the system is the first puzzle you've got to solve. Once in, you'll soon find out that you've accidentally stumbled upon a conspiracy of global impact. From then on, you'll maneuver a robotic drone around the globe through a tunnel system deep in the earth. In major cities, you may surface and talk to contact persons, who'll trade items for cash. When delivered to the correct city, you can exchange these items for a piece of evidence. If all evidence is collected, you're to inform the FBI. As if figuring out the correct routes and trades wasn't hard enough, frequent system malfunctions and security checks test your skill as well...</desc>

A long hallway with seven doorways in it at the start offers the player the opportunity to enter dungeon areas of varying difficulty (easiest and more open at the top, hardest at the bottom). In these areas of the tower, the player can explore, finding treasure and elixir bottles (which can be used to replenish the player's magic). Of course, things aren't that simple. The Things roam the various corridors and will chase and attack the player on sight, even going so far as to disguise themselves as ordinary objects until the player comes in range. Fortunately, the player has sword and bow, as well as magical spells, to defend and heal himself. Will this be enough for you to raise a fortune in loot or will The Things see you to your doom?</desc>

Armed with a big hammer, your job is to prevent the American Indians from reaching the tower behind your fort by hitting them on the head and putting out the fires that are thrown from the side. That's really it to the game -- new levels bring different backgrounds (battleship, castle and space base) with corresponding enemies (pirates, knights and aliens), but essentially the same gameplay.

		<name>Hard Drivin'</name>
		<desc>Hard Drivin' is a 3D arcade hit from Atari Games. You are in control of a high-performance sports car. Your objective is to race around the course as fast as possible and hit as many checkpoints as possible. If you hit a checkpoint you gain extra time to go farther. You will see traffic on the road both in your direction and coming down the opposite direction, so be careful when you pass... The course has two sections: speed track, and stunt track. Speed track is longer, but you can usually achieve higher speeds. Stunt track requires you to perform several stunts such as jumping bridges, driving through a loop, and so on. Crashing the car has no serious consequences and indeed shows a replay of your crash from a cinematic angle. Admire your crash head-on into the cement truck, or clipping the minivan, or flying off the bridge in the wrong angle... You lose several seconds as your car is "reset" and you get up to speed again. The home conversions retain most of the then-advanced 3D graphics but lack the force-feedback that was in the arcade version.</desc>

		<desc>Rotund drinkers Harvey Headbanger and Hamish Highball are at war in this single-screen action duel with a strategic edge. Walking across each of the 64 squares will turn them to your colour. Create a 3x3 box of these squares to release cocktails (of your own colour, so only you can use them) and top up your energy. Contact costs each player energy, but the player with a higher energy level can get up first. The aim to win a point is to trap your opponent inside a box of your squares. You can play to anything from 1 to 10 points, and at 5 difficulty levels in a one-player game.</desc>

		<name>Hawk Storm</name>
		<desc>Hawk Storm is a brave warrior living on the planet Edos, and its citizens look up to him for survival. Edos has only one source of energy: the giant capacitoid crystals, capable of storing energy by day and regenerate that energy during the icy cold nights. Having realized this, the evil Nevik warriors decided to steal all but two of these crystals, making it impossible to sustain normal life on the planet. As a result, all of the people are forced to go in a Life Suspension Program, except Hawk, who must recover all thirty-two stolen crystals if Edos is to survive. The Neviks are scattered throughout Edos to make sure that Hawk does not succeed in his quest, but Hawk can collect up to three different weapons  shields, mines, and stryders  that can be used against them. Also scattered around are various hazards such as firepits, slimeballs, spikes, and gun turrets, which can cause Hawk to lose some energy if he collides into them. There are several objects which Hawk can use to his advantage. Energy pods can restore his energy, lifts can be used to reach higher platforms, and teleports can take him to different areas.</desc>

		<desc>Two distinct characters called Mr Head and Mr Heels are played in this arcade adventure. They are separated at the shoulders but capable of joining together to maximize their abilities in some situations (but reduce them in others, so they can be split again). The game is presented from an isometric perspective, and presents the characters with a number of puzzles involving switches, jumps and climbs. The levels are 3 dimensional, and the characters must collect crowns as they progress. Objects can be picked up and manipulated as necessary.</desc>

		<desc>Heartland's meta-referential plot involves a struggle between good and evil, as depicted in a book, the last six pages of which have become lost. As a result, you must dive into the game's world to complete the story, and ensure that evil doesn't win, by saving the white pages and destroying the black ones. There are six levels, all with distinctly cutesy themes and colourful graphics. The level layouts are extremely complicated, and you have to make your way back to base after each one, before being transported onto the next one, all within a time limit. The levels are full of wizards who must be shot, as well as a small amount of character interaction.</desc>

		<name>Heavy Metal</name>
		<desc>This multi-genre military action game puts player in the seat of tactical commander of mechanized forces. Starting as Cadet, you'll raise your career from the rookie, when you should perform actions by yourself in different vehicles, to the ultimate elite, when you should act as a Tactical genius. There are three kinds of combat simulations: 1. MBT (main battle tank M1A1 Abrams), where in first-person view you should sit in tank's cockpit, command your gunner and driver, and eliminate surrounding enemies; 2. FAV (fast attack vehicle XR311), where in third-person view you should drive your vehicle in desert, shoot scattered obstacles and enemy helicopters, and avoid the bombs dropped from the skies ; 3. ADAT (air defense anti-tank M1132A), where in first-person view you should shoot air and ground enemies, surrounding your statical position. Performing useful actions in each mode, you'll gain points, and gathering 5,000 points in each mode will give you a seat of Tactical Commander. Here you'll be able to continue your actions on the field, or perform some tactical moves using the map, which is very similar to the territory, including and surrounding Western Germany.</desc>

		<name>Heavy on the Magick</name>
		<desc>With full graphics throughout, Heavy on the Magick aimed the standard adventure style at a wider audience. Axil the Able is stuck in Collodon's pile, and he must find a way out. At the start, the game will randomly generate his Skill, Stamina and Luck - you can regenerate these if you don't like the initial values. As you play your experience statistic will increase. The graphics are created in memory before being copied onto the screen; this causes some pixellated areas, but there's a full examine option with some helpful hints as to the item's benefit/risk. The lair is on many levels, and most rooms have multiple exits across the 8 compass directions. Vampires and Werewolves are among the many creatures which guard the corridors - you use magic to kill or freeze these, although some can be beaten back by possessing certain objects.</desc>

		<name>Helichopper</name>
		<desc>Your people's clones are trapped behind an electric fence on each of the 23 levels of this action game. To rescue them you must pull up next to the fence and wait for them to cross, before placing them into one of the gaps on the left of the screen. The correct one to place the clone into cycles through in sequence. On each level a set number of these must be rescued. The difficulty is that a swamp lies between the fence and the safety zone, and it is constantly spawning creatures who kill you on contact. You are armed with bombs with kill in a direct downward trajectory, so will be using the top area of the screen a lot. Although you can slot into one of the home-cells and wait for the sequence to cycle round, this runs the risk of becoming trapped in the section as the swamp-creatures encroach. The colour of the swamp things dictates the score but not the difficulty. On later levels there are static hazards on screen, as well as enemies firing at you.</desc>

The King of Argos gives him 12 labours that he has to fulfill. These twelve labours are symbolized by icons that appear occasionally on the screen. You have to collect these labours while fighting off skeletons that carry swords. The fights take place in ancient Greek temples amongst other places. If you hit a labour it will put into an urn but a spider tries to steal the labours from you. Kill it with a well placed blow. If all twelve labours have been collected he must face the the end boss of the game, the mighty Minotaur.</desc>

		<desc>The town of the game's hero is under a curse from an evil wizard. He has stolen the Golden Talisman that had protected the city in the past. Broken into five pieces, the Talisman is hidden in a labyrinth filled with monsters. Now the hero has to find all five pieces of the Talisman and destroy the evil wizard in order to restore peace to the city. The labyrinth is explored from a side scrolling perspective. It is composed of 64 room spread over five levels. Each room is 8 screens large, providing a total of 512 screens to explore. The goal of each level is to find a piece of the Talisman while fighting off lots of different monsters ranging from birds to jumping eyeballs to fire-breathing dragons. The hero can jump, climb ropes, swim and shoot as well as pick up different power-ups and objects. He can carry five objects, but only hold/use one at a time. Pressing the space bar changes the object in use. Usable objects include keys, ropes, lamps to light dark rooms, flags that improve the hero's firepower and others. Power-ups can be collected to replenish health or air. If the hero runs out of air, being underwater will slowly decrease his health. To help the hero finding his way through the labyrinth, a map is shown at the lower left side of the screen. It marks all visited rooms, shows his current position and indicates whether there are any items in a room.</desc>

		<name>Hero Quest</name>
		<desc>The famous fantasy-themed board game was converted into an isometric-viewed role playing game in which the evil Wizard Morcar must be defeated. You take control of a wizard, a dwarf, a barbarian and an elf, each with different strengths and weaknesses, who each start the 14 missions from opposite sides of the board. Strict turn-based movement rules apply, as actions other than movement can only be carried out before or after the move, the size of which is limited by a dice roll. These moves are carried out using an icon-based system. Characters can fight the many monsters which lurk, or cast spells to vanquish them. There are magic potions to uncover, but also hidden traps, so mapping is advised. Treasure can be collected, and traded at the shop after each level.</desc>

		<name>High Frontier</name>
		<desc>When High Frontier was created, America was investing heavily in the original 'Star Wars' SDI, to fend off a feared Soviet missile attack. Your job in this strategy game is to oversee its development. The game is played via an icon control system, with a common set of icons and information panels are displayed around these screens. There are six distinct screens used to make the decisions, plus the ability to track existing satellites and keep track of active Soviet attacks. The Research &amp; Development screen is the first port of call. It is split into six components, to which you must assign money and staff. The President will give the order to arm or disarm your units (including the activation code). Once you have working SDIs and the permission codes, you can launch them using the Shield screen. Espionage and Reconnaissance cameras are located to keep track of enemy development, although these figures are not always precise. The Threats screen lets you keep track of enemy resources and moods. The World screen effectively moves the game forward in time.</desc>

		<path>./Highlander (Europe).zip</path>
		<name>Highlander</name>
		<desc>The 1986 cult film Highlander is the basis of this adaptation, which reduces the film to its swordfighting scenes. Taking the role of the immortal Highlander Connor MacLeod, the player has to win three consecutive battles against increasingly skilled opponents: MacLeod's teacher Ramirez, a character named Fizir, and finally the mighty Kurgan, the main antagonist of the movie. A battle is won by depleting the enemy of his energy. Energy is lost by being hit, or by attempting an attack that is blocked by the enemy. To win, a combination of attacking and parrying moves is necessary, of which several are available depending on the character's stance (standing or crouched) and the direction the joystick is pushed. Two players can engage in a duel in two-player mode.</desc>

		<path>./Hijack (Europe).zip</path>
		<name>Hijack</name>
		<desc>You are the head of the US Governments Hijack Division, and you are called into action when a group of terrorists hijack a vehicle. You have three potential ways to foil them  get enough money to bribe them, use political influence to over-rule them, or bring in military force. To achieve any of these tasks, you will need to work with the President, FBI and CIA agents, Military and Political Advisers, and other staff including the Secretary to keep you in contact with them. You have a time limit, which the President can attempt to extend with the hijackers if you request this. You control your characters left-right movement through the buildings directly, including entering lifts to switch rooms, but moving the controller up or down moves a cursor along rows of icons at the top and bottom of the screen. The screen also has graphs to indicate your current political, military and financial situations. Most important of these are the chances to interact with other staff members, provided they are in the room. There are at least two requests you can make to each of them  The President can be asked for more support, an FBI Agent can question staff to ensure that there is no inside information. CIA Agents can give information about the hijackers, with 3 levels of detail, the more advanced ones taking longer. Press releases must be issued to ensure good publicity (and thus keep the President on your side) and funds raised to help with a financial solution. Your final target is to go to the scene of the hijack and negotiate with the terrorists. You can bring your key advisers with you, to increase the chance of a correct outcome.</desc>

		<desc>(From The Infocom Homepage Entry) As a child, you spent most of your summers with your Aunt Hildegarde and Uncle Buddy. What memories! Uncle Buddy was a Hollywood big-shot, Aunt Hildegarde his loving (and very rich) wife. They had no children of their own, but you and your cousins loved their house, their parties, the Hollywood memorabilia, and them. Sure, Buddy and Hildy were a bit eccentric -- but that added to their charm. Aunt Hildegarde kept the house when Uncle Buddy passed away. And now that she's suddenly died, you remember her unusual will. You will inherit the entire estate -- probably worth millions if you can spend just one night in the house and on the grounds, find a treasure or two. But if you can't then you inherit nothing. And so Hollywood Hijinx begins with you being dropped off in front of a dark house, not to far from Hollywood ...</desc>

From there on you must maneuver yourself through each of the levels full of obstacles like the Baron's thugs, collapsing platforms, conveyor belts, oil and acid patches. Hong Kong Phooeys health is displayed via the "Hong Kong Phooey Book of Kung Fu" meter located on the bottom left of the screen. Collect drinks to help replenish your health, unlock doors and activate switches to help advance further into the level to find Baron Von Bankjob and bring him to justice.</desc>

		<name>Hot Rod</name>
		<desc>Hot Rod is a top-view racing game influenced by Super Sprint, in which three miniature cars race to complete a race as quickly as possible, by rotating, accelerating and braking at the right moments. You start with limited fuel, but more can be collected as you cover the track. Hitting hazards can cause your car to explode, thus costing time as it is replaced. Unusually the racetracks are linear rather than lap-based, so each round involves covering a section of track once. After each race, you can purchase upgrades at the shop, depending on how much money you earned in the previous race. Only part of the circuit is shown at a time, and this scrolls following the leader. If you fail to keep up with this, your car is moved forward on the track, with a penalty fuel deduction. This is slightly similar to the system later used in head-to-head games of Micro Machines, and is especially punishing while you are on roads travelling horizontally and the leading CPU car is travelling vertically, as it makes the margin for error much smaller.</desc>

		<desc>A simple two-player game released to much marketing fanfare, Hotshot places you and another player (either another person or an AI robot) in an arena split down the middle into two save for a hole about half the screen's height for the ball to travel through, with a series of bricks on each side to destroy. The aim of the game is to destroy your own bricks before your opponent can destroy his. This is achieved by catching the small by pointing your suction device at it and holding fire, and then releasing in the needed by letting go of the button. This is easier said than done, as the ball neither moves in a straight line or according to the natural rules of.gravity. Should either player be hit with the ball and not catch it properly, they will be knocked down and possession of the ball is passed to the other player.</desc>

		<name>How to be a Complete Bastard</name>
		<desc>This game is based around cult alternative comedian Ade Edmondsons book of the same name. Having gate-crashed a party full of sophisticated well-behaved types, you must do everything you can to be seen as hateful, yobbish and immature  a Complete Bastard. The house has several rooms, each of which are filled with objects which are of use, as well as unlimited supplies of food, alcohol and coffee, which control how drunk you are at a time  some awful actions force you to be sober, others force you to be drunk. The game also displays whether you need the toilet (or, more accurately, any part of the house that would cause offence), whether you need to fart, and how strong-smelling these are. The rooms can all be viewed from multiple angles, and 2 can be viewed at a time through a split-screen view. To win, you need to prove to all 16 party guest that you are a complete bastard.</desc>

		<name>How to be a Hero</name>
		<desc>This Gauntlet-inspired arcade adventure has three separate challenges, each of which can be loaded from the main screen. All are viewed from above, and involve shooting enemies (contact with whom drains your energy). Your health is represented by gradually-withering pineapples, which are recharged by eating food. The first is set in Egypt - you are locked inside a treasure-packed temple, and must escape through seven locked doors, each of which has its own key. The second sees you on a doomed spaceship, needing to collect security passes and circuit board pieces. The third is in a city full of mutants - escape passages are locked and a crucial document is in 24 pieces. The minimum target of escaping involves collecting keys - note that each barrier has only one way of being opened. To be a true hero, you must collect the sets of 24 treasure pieces/circuit board pieces/torn document pieces within the levels.</desc>

		<desc>Your two best friends Phil and Beverly have been captured by a dark overlord! He is keeping them captive in an active volcano, and you need to rescue them. As Howard the Duck, master of Quack Fu, you need to make your way through the maze-like landscapes, and jump or fight the many obstacles blocking the path using kicks and punches. Water must be navigated around, because this 'superhero' duck can't swim. Or fly without the parachute you regularly use. Quicksand, enemy mutants and more will all get in your way before you can finally parachute into the volcano and defeat the dark overlord! Howard the Duck is based on 'Escape From Volcano island', a cartoon featuring Howard, but was released to tie in with the movie of the same name.</desc>

		<desc>In today's moral climate, it seems that almost everyone is living by the rule 'kill or be killed'. Some people are taking the idea to extremes, plunging into danger just to prove that they are really tough and a lot stupider than the rest. In this game, players control Kwon, dubbed the Human Killing Machine. He has vowed to demonstrate the power of his homeland; and does this by battling a series of opponents in several countries such as Moscow, Amsterdam, and Barcelona. HKM uses the term 'knockdown' for players who defeat their current opponent. Three knockdowns are needed for the player to move onto the next opponent. Bonus points are awarded for the remaining energy Kwon has when he has successfully defeated his opponent. The player has five lives, and if all of them are used up, the game is over.</desc>

When finalizing the projection, everybody was pending of the exit of Humphrey and when this one appeared, well, that seemed uncontrollable. All fans jumped on his back and began to embrace, to kiss, to clear the clothes to him... just a little bit and had been the first film actor attacked in public. Humphrey finished in hospital with all kind of contusions and a nervous crisis that him left postrated in the bed during several months. When he recovered, he changed of house with the intention to obtain some privacy and to avoid that they took place more incidents like the one than took to the hospital. But it seems that our friend was nothing lucky.

		<desc>Victor Hugo never could have expected that his creation Quasimodo, the Hunchback of Notre Dame, would run such an obstacle course as is dished up in this game, dodging fireballs and arrows while leaping over pits and pikemen, sometimes with the help of a swinging bell-pull rope, in hopes of rescuing his beloved Esmeralda from the top tower -- all while being slow-but-steady chased across the castle parapets by an invincible knight in full armour. Once you get the hang of any individual obstacle, the game starts throwing them at you in tandem, until toward the end you're tracking the swing of the rope, the thrust of the lance, the approach of the arrow and the advance of the knight all simultaneously! Succeed, against all odds, and you get to do it again, but faster! Even an able-bodied protagonist would have a hard time juggling all these threats, but I have a feeling a dedicated player with patience and good timing can overcome them. Let's call it a hunch.</desc>

		<desc>The archetype of the Hunchback of Notre Dame really isn't terribly nuanced: he jumps around towers, ringing bells, rescuing Esmeralda and being generally physically unattractive. Here he does all of these things, in a more platform-oriented take than the original, clambering up dangling ropes as they rise and fall, avoiding environmental threats such as rabid bats, thrown hatchets and enormous grinding clockwork gears all in the pursuit of small bells strewn across each screen's platforms. Gathering all the bells permits you to advance higher up the tower, at the top of which the damsel in distress awaits your homely visage.</desc>

		<desc>Jorund, king of the Vikings, and father of our protagonist, has fallen for the deceits of Loki, Viking God of the lie. This deceit had as consequence the confinement of Jorund in the kingdom of Lukx, from where nobody has ever returned. Because of this deceit the Viking king has profaned the prohibited garden of the Norns. In there are found a great part of the treasure that the Gods keep jealous, as well as some of the nymphs more beautiful than ever a human eye has contemplated. Before such attractiveness, Jorund fell for the deceit of Loki and profaned the garden. The wrath of the Gods fell on him and their punishment did not take long: they would border to him to perpetuity to the kingdom of Lukx, where their inhabitants would give good account of the bones of our protagonist. But Hundra was not resigned to that her father died in that exile, and therefore, could not reach Valhalla, paradise of the viking warriors. Decided to change the fate of her father, she went to the Viking Mount Olympus where she convinced the Gods that her father had been deceived. They admitted their mistake, and saw that the punishment had been excessive; but their decisions were irrevocable and there was no way to save Jorund from his terrible end. Hundra offered to go to the kingdom of Lukx, and gather three sacred gems, stolen a long time ago from the Gods, to rescue her father.</desc>

The specific objects required to clear each plug must be obtained, in many cases by shooting the enemies who hold them - a task made harder by the fact that contact with them is fatal, you start without weaponry, and no weapon has unlimited ammunition. Whirlpools and bubbles must be used to reach the various areas of the Deathbowl. Contact with water causes Sweevo to start rusting, although oil can be picked up to limit the effect.

You must complete each event in order to be allowed onto the next one. Swimming involves moving left and right as fast as possible, while pressing fire when a breath is required. Skeet shooting and archery both come down to timing - though elevation and wind factors affect the latter. Gymnastics involves timing a succession of presses to ensure that the jump is long and the landing graceful. The triple jump involves one press for each part of the jump, whereas the weightlifting involves merely brute strength.</desc>

		<desc>Super Bowl XX, in which Chicago trounced New England 46-10, is recreated in this action/strategy hybrid, which also features computer AI for a solo match on the C64 version (Spectrum owners can only practice plays on their own). When kicking, the player controls the kick's strength and accuracy by pressing fire, so the direction isn't under direct control, and punts can only be returned if they are caught on the full. When selecting the play, a distinction is made between long and short passing plays. You select the recipient when the ball is in play by moving the cursor which appears and pressing fire. If a catch is made, you can take control of any player, which needn't be the player running for the end-zone. Running and Special Teams plays are also on offer of course. When on the defense, the player has 4 main positional strategies to choose from, and can specify individual markers, and a player to simply track the ball carrier. Any individual player can be controlled once the action begins, and holding down fire allows you to change this player as the play unfolds.</desc>

		<desc>Impossaball puts you in control of a ball, and sets you in a checkered 3D environment with walls and ceilings. The ball bounces on the spot as standard, but can be directed to move, or bounce higher to gain momentum. Your task is to land on every cylinder in the level, so as to squash them down to ground level. Lots of spikes protrude in the levels, which must be avoided. Magic rings are both friend and foe - the first contact increases your remaining time, but a further contact loses a life. Other obstacles cause the ball to rebound, which could be good or bad depending on the situation.</desc>

		<desc>Monty Mole has been living in luxury since his previous adventures, but he has now been beamed up by an alien race who want him to do a job for them. Monty must trek through five worlds to retrieve the sacred scrolls of the race's Guardians. As with Core's previous hit Rick Dangerous 2 there is versatility in the exact structure of the game. The first four consist of the Orient, a Klondike mine, an Ice world and an Amazon forest - once these are completed the final world is open to you. The platform-based gameplay is similar to Monty's earlier games, with primarily horizontal progresses as well as ropes and ladders to navigate. Monty has developed a useful flying kick, and has been given a smart bomb, with the potential to collect extra bombs and guns. Hazards, enemies and level designs are themed around each level, and range from cable cars and falling snowballs to Ninjas and Monkeys.</desc>

		<desc>As in the movie (and the more famous graphic adventure), your task is to find the Holy Grail. Before this can be done you must find the Cross of Coronado, a shield and a diary. This makes for a four-level arcade adventure combining climbs, exploration (with several routes through each level, and some traps) and puzzles. Indy is armed with his trusty whip to fight off foes, but can also get involved in hand-to-hand combat. The first level takes place in caves underneath Colorado, before you reach a moving circus train strewn with traps, a Zeppelin which is full of guards and ladders, and then Castle Grunwald in Austria.</desc>

		<name>Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom</name>
		<desc>The computer versions of Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom are conversions of the Atari arcade game based on the second movie in the series. As Indy you must complete several cycles of the following 3 types of levels:Mine level: Whip your way through a mine in order to free children that are held captive. Use your whip to swing across chasms, climb ladders, ride along conveyor belts and defend yourself against attacks from Thuggee guards, bats, snakes and the fireball-throwing Mola ram. Escape with the mine cart after you've freed all children. 2. Mine cart level: Pick the right route through a network of tracks while riding in a mine cart. Avoid potholes, broken tracks &amp; guards in carts and safely reach the end of the track. 3. Temple level: Make your way to the altar and grab the Sankara stone while Mola Ram, bats and Thuggee guards attack you. Watch out for that lava. With every cycle the mine &amp; mine cart levels become more complex, the layout of the temple levels is always the same. After several cycles there's a showdown with Mola Ram on the rope bridge.</desc>

		<name>Indoor Sports</name>
		<desc>Four Indoor Sports are compiled in this entry to DesignStar's SportTime line of recreations. Ten-Pin Bowling, Air Hockey, Darts and (except on the Commodore 64) Ping Pong are featured. The menus and options screens have the same feel as Clubhouse Sports. Each game has computer opponents at multiple skill levels plus human-versus-human and demo modes, and matches can consist of varying numbers of rounds, with other options depending on the game. Ten-pin bowling is played from a side-on view, although once the shot has been taken you see the results unfold from the bowler's view. There are three stages to taking a shot. Move the player up and down to line up his run-up, pressing fire to set the position. Then, do the same to set the angle of the shot. Finally, after pressing fire to start the run-up, press it again to time the release of the ball, as close to the line as possible. Darts has 4 skill and 3 speed levels, and players can play to 301, 501 or 701, to vary game length or provide a handicapping system. You can also set whether scoring must start or end with a double. Viewed from behind the board, you must first line up the dart, then set the dart's curvature and power by stopping a curved gauge on the right, then a rising power bar on the left. The view then changes twice - first a behind-the-player view to show the dart's approach, then a close-up of the board to show where it landed. Air Hockey plays for five minutes, or until someone has scored 12 points. The view is above the pitch but angled so as to emphasize the goal at the top. Ping-Pong features a handicapping system - six ability areas can be graded from 1-5, to ensure a closely-matched game. Again the view is from behind one court. To impart direction onto a shot, the angle must be pressed at the same time as the fire button.</desc>

Ingrid has three cunning plans to stop him - producing a petition with everybody's signature, finding a more orthodox prevention method, and finally infiltrating Ridley's Manor itself by pretending to be a maid, and then finding proof that he's a dodgy geezer who should be locked up. These three quests can be played in any order, although they logically follow on from each other. She is accompanied by Flopsy the dog in the first 2 parts, and her cousin Daisy in the third. Ingrid's Back uses the same game system as the original, and other contemporary Level 9 titles such as Knight Orc . Giving instructions to other characters (including Flopsy) and jumping around the map using GO TO and FOLLOW commands. A living and breathing world of people travelling, trading and relaxing underpins it all, and plays a part in most puzzles.</desc>

		<desc>Take over managing a European international football team in this budget game. An initial team of 11 players and 2 substitutes is selected automatically for you from the roster of 24 squad members and another 16 'hopefuls', but you can move these at will. You can choose your team's formation, playing style and tactics, to give you a fighting chance of qualifying from the 4-team groups to reach the major championships. Team training must also be organised. During the match you can see which part of the pitch the ball is in (Premier Manager later used a similar system) as well as updates on key moments.</desc>

		<desc>Seven-a-side rugby union is brought to life in this budget game. The action is viewed from the side, although kicks to the posts are played from a behind-the-posts perspective. Scrums and line-outs are incorporated for as realistic a game as possible given the player restriction. A tournament can be played with up to 8 players, with as many computer teams as required to fill the gaps. In the ST version the tactical side of the game is very complex - seventeen different formations are on offer. Other gameplay variables can be set - player stamina (lower values forcing you to play a more conservative game), how long a player takes to recover from a tackle, and the standard strengths of passes and kicks, pus some very complicated mathematical coefficients. The ability to rename teams, change kits and alter the match lengths seem banal by comparison.</desc>

		<desc>Pandora's first game combines the Gauntlet style with the World War 2 setting, and specifically the Eagle's Nest building which is being used by a commander as his HQ. Three Allied soldiers have been captured, and you must infiltrate the facilities, rescue your brave comrades, destroy the building, and salvage as much of the stolen art treasures as possible. There are eight levels to explore, each with a specific mission objective. Some of the paintings are loose, others are in crates which must first be shot. Explosives must be collected, not shot. With limited ammunition, guards everywhere, keys at a premium, and lots of strategic hiding points, an all-guns-blazing approach is less successful than a planned, measured one.</desc>

		<desc>Strategy games with a real-time movement element didn't begin with Dune 2, and this was one early implementation of the concept. Your army has landed on an alien planet and has the intention of destroying their weather control station, and ideally as many of their units as possible. The action is viewed from above, and you use a cursor to direct units, and automatically target and attack enemy units. Once you blow up the weather control tower, by exploding at least 2 bombs next to it, you must flee the planet ASAP. Protecting all your units is important and requires a tactical overview approach, but the bombs are particularly vital.</desc>

The ball needs to be guided from the start of a level to the end, through 4 linked sections. Various functioning squares must be used to your advantage. Uniquely these include changes to the ball's size, as well as it's physics. Revolving squares randomly fire the ball off in another direction, and ramps shoot you in the current direction at high speed. Weapons can be collected, as can shields - both of which are required to avoid some of the hazards on show. Black holes are always fatal however.</desc>

		<name>Iznogoud</name>
		<desc>This game from 1987 is based on the adventures of the French comic book character Iznogoud. You are in the role of the Grand Vizier Iznogoud, whose only thought is to depose the Caliph of magical Baghdad and become "Caliph instead of the Caliph!" To accomplish this aim, you must wander around and interact with characters around you, acquiring objects along the way that may or may not be useful, and figure out how all this will help you achieve your goal. During the game, you have 4 different methods of interacting with other characters: you can give objects to them, you can threaten them, you can flatter them, and you can throw a tantrum. Depending on the character, these actions will elicit different responses--or none altogether. You will need objects for various things, and objects are all acquired from other characters. Some characters are helpful, others are not. But the right combination of your actions will help you to become Caliph instead of the Caliph, while the wrong ones will often land you in a cell beneath the palace. Just be careful not to lose your own head in the process!</desc>

		<desc>Jack and the Beanstalk has the player controlling Jack, a young boy determined to steal the giant's treasures. The game consists of four levels. In the first level, Jack must climb a beanstalk to the top while avoiding worms, spiders, and birds. Jack may obtain a weapon in this level and use it to kill them. In the second level, Jack climbs a series of brick walls while avoiding the same enemies, and collects the money bag at the top and leaves the screen in the upper-left. On level three, Jack climbs the fireplace to get to the golden goose in the cage, then climbs down a ladder to the bottom. Finally, level four has Jack climb up the giant to reach the table, where a huge money bag resides. The game ends when Jack completes his objective or when all of his lives are lost.</desc>

		<desc>The enemy army has captured too many of your forces. Being held in P.O.W. camps, these soldiers are effectively out of the war... unless some kind of rescue operation can be mounted. Heavy Forces are too slow and visible to be of any use, but perhaps something smaller and lighter may make it in where larger forces would fail. A small jeep, maybe two, crewed by about 4 people.... minimal enough not to represent too much of a loss and yet suitable enough to aid in rescue. But of course, if these brave men want to succeed AND come back alive; they'll need to fight like animals... they'll need to fight like jackals... Jackal is an overhead view jeep game for up to 2 players. The controller moves in four directions, button A fires your gernades (upgradable to bazooka) and button B your machine gun which ALWAYS fires to the top of the screen. Your mission is to locate facilities where soldiers are being held prisoner, rescue as many as possible, and escort them to a safe landing zone where they will be air transported away. After that, you'll need to fight a boss battle against the enemy to progress.</desc>

The games are disputed between two teams (composed of two players each one), with a scoring system very similar to the one of table tennis; it is, we will be able to score if we are in possession of the serve, in opposite case, our successes will only allow us to recover it. But instead of a net, we will have to play with a wall, using it as our "third player".</desc>

By rescuing hostages along the way, you can obtain a number of weapons, such as a pistol and a tear gas gun, and you can select them by using the weapons select area at the bottom of the screen.

Having struck it lucky in the first game, Willy now owns a lavish mansion with over 60 rooms linked in a 3D plane, and must tidy it all before his housekeeper will let him sleep. Each room has its own hazards, such as spikes, revolving razors and ropes. The route through the house must be navigated carefully, due to the multiple entrances to some rooms - this is perhaps the first action game where mapping is an advantage. Another innovation, to the chagrin of players everywhere, is manual protection - a sheet of colour-coded numbers.</desc>

		<desc>Aquatania has recently become the land of misfortunes, due to a group of plotting witches. The task of finding five charms and a magic bracelet to put things right falls on you. And you need a change of luck, because events in this game often emphasise the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune. You get hit by a car, fall a great height, sprayed with cheese sandwich and more! Being the guinea pig in this strange world will drive you insane - if this jinxed land doesn't do it first. Jinxter is an interactive fiction with graphics title that takes a realistic world of people and situations, and then plays with the boundaries to create a strange and puzzling world. Characters are all getting on with their own tasks, and getting them to help you is usually a case of making sure something's in it for them. Dialogue aims to add a comic touch to proceedings. Puzzles can often be solved in multiple ways, but the most obvious way is not always the correct one. Due to the presence of a Guardian, you can't actually die.</desc>

		<name>Jinxter</name>
		<desc>Aquatania has recently become the land of misfortunes, due to a group of plotting witches. The task of finding five charms and a magic bracelet to put things right falls on you. And you need a change of luck, because events in this game often emphasise the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune. You get hit by a car, fall a great height, sprayed with cheese sandwich and more! Being the guinea pig in this strange world will drive you insane - if this jinxed land doesn't do it first. Jinxter is an interactive fiction with graphics title that takes a realistic world of people and situations, and then plays with the boundaries to create a strange and puzzling world. Characters are all getting on with their own tasks, and getting them to help you is usually a case of making sure something's in it for them. Dialogue aims to add a comic touch to proceedings. Puzzles can often be solved in multiple ways, but the most obvious way is not always the correct one. Due to the presence of a Guardian, you can't actually die.</desc>

		<desc>Tough guy Joe Blade must rescue six respected leaders from the madcap Crax Bloodfinger, who has kidnapped them in different areas of his base. Along the way he will find six bombs which must be activated, leaving him with only 20 minutes to rescue everyone. Joe Blade is viewed side-on and uses flick-screen progression. The bombs are deactivated by arranging letters into alphabetical order, but the bulk of the gameplay involves shooting and maze navigation. The screens are linked in various ways, and contain a number of keys which must be used correctly.</desc>

		<name>Joe Blade II</name>
		<desc>As Players Software correctly predicted, London in 1995 is an unfriendly unsafe city ran by thugs. Innocent civilians who leave the house will almost certainly face violence. An acclaimed hero since his successes in the original, Joe Blade is the man to put things right - if he can kill 100 thugs and rescue 20 civilians within ten minutes, the thugs will retreat and the city will be saved. As Joe, you must move through the streets and kill these thugs, by kicking them in the head (they have body armour). As in the first game, the streets are flick-screen and have many doorways linking them. Rescuing civilians involves touching them before completing a sub-game within a minute. There are four subgame variants of increasing difficulty, all based around a 1-2-3-4 sequence of numbers. The first involves simply stopping the cursor as each one appears in order - pressing the wrong one sends you back to having to find a 1. In the second, the numbers are on screen in random order, a cursor cycling through them - press fire to swap the two numbers currently highlighted. In the third, you are presented with two jumbled sets and must put one of them in order, by swapping numbers across the two sets. In the fourth, you must form the sequence by swapping an ever-changing number into the right place, by pressing fire at the right moment.</desc>

		<desc>In John Elway's Quarterback, it's one player vs. the computer or two human players going head-to-head in single-game American football action. Select your team's home city (there is no NFL or NFLPA license, so there are no real teams or players) and then battle the opposing team for four 15-minute (accelerated real-time) quarters. Graphics are simple: one team has blue uniforms, the other team red ones. The human player gets control of the quarterback on offense and the middle linebacker on defense. The play perspective is top-down and vertical-scrolling. Choose from 9 offensive--mostly passing--plays and 6 defensive plays. Teams have 9 players each.</desc>

Jonah calls the score, and claimed that the program could boost a player's squash skills, as well as provide entertainment. Jonah Barrington's Squash features one and two player modes, with 4 difficulty levels. Accurate rebounds are implemented, and the ball's bounce is visible from its shadow. Realistic tactics appear to produce the correct effects, in terms of playing attacking or defensive.</desc>

The first level involves shooting at birds, with a minimum of 3 required to progress. You must aim in front of the birds, so as to allow for the distance they will cover as the bullet travels. In the third level you are now shooting at bad guys, who emerge from locations (bank, saloon, store) on an accurate Wild West layout. The second level sees you attempting to jump over rocks and cacti, whereas level 4 involves jumping across a speeding train in order to wrestle control of it.</desc>

		<desc>In the 24th century, Earth is pounded by solar explosions and abandoned by humans, and the planet is recolonized by a dangerous race known as Kat Men. When the solar explosions died, the humans decide to return to Earth. When the Kat Men refuse to leave, a war droid known as MT-ED, or Multi Terrain Exploration Droid, is sent down to deal with the Kat Men. Accompanying him is Hercules 1, a maintenance and combat droid. When the two droids are beamed down, things take a turn for the worse. Hercules is kidnapped and taken far away to the Kat Men's Nerve Center. It is MT-ED's task to get rid of the Kat Men and rescue Hercules. To do this, MT-ED has to explore fourteen environments and deal with deadly creatures that are within each environment, with each type of creature requiring a certain type of weapon to be defeated. These weapons - including lasers, water bombs, grenades, and rockets - can be picked up along the way, and MT-ED can switch between them with ease. If MT-ED comes into contact with any of the creatures, he is kicked into the air and gets stunned for a few seconds. If this happens, he loses one of his lives. Not all creatures are deadly; some of them will steal whatever weapons MT-ED is carrying at the time. Besides using weapons to kill, MT-ED also has the ability to jump over creatures that may be too slow for him to shoot. When MT-ED finally rescues Hercules, a sub-game needs to be completed. When MT-ED completed this sub-game, the Kat Men's Central Computer is disabled and the Kat Men go back where they came from.</desc>

		<name>Kenny Dalglish Soccer Manager</name>
		<desc>By 1989 Kenny Dalglish scarcely played for Liverpool, and was almost entirely concentrating on his role as manager, so a football management game with no arcade action featuring his license made sense. The game is purely icon- and menu-driven, perhaps the first step in dragging the genre into the 90s. Whichever team you took charge of start from the 4th division. Match highlights can be selected - these are viewed from the side and show goals and near-misses, although they can be turned off. You start with squads of over 20 players from which to choose your team of 11, each given a straightforward ability rating. Formations can be selected by placing each player in a precise position alongside the formation of the opposition team, using a fairly advanced system for the time. Via a separate menu you can consult with the chairman (to see if he's happy with your efforts), the physio (to check for injuries), the scout (who comes up with players you might like to purchase) and so on.</desc>

		<name>Kick Off</name>
		<desc>Kick Off was the first football game of its kind, having a top down view and unlike other football games of that time the ball was not glued to the feet of the players. Playing Kick Off requires skills in boll control. There is an option to learn these skills without being harassed by the opposition. The set pieces like corner kicks, passing, sliding tackles and dribbling can be practiced to perfection. Each player on the pitch has a unique combination of 4 attributes, namely Pace, Stamina, Accuracy and Aggression. As you progress you will need to adapt to to different types of players. You can play in a league consisting of 8 teams. The teams in the league are on the whole evenly matched but have different styles of play with players attribute to match that style. There is 12 different referees in the game.</desc>

		<desc>The original Kick Off was expanded on in many ways for this sequel. The game now features full tournament modes (although the players on the teams are fictitious) and four different pitches (including an implementation of plastic pitches, whose uneven bounce cause controversy when several British clubs tried them in the 1980s). Viewed top-down, the controls involve trapping the ball under your foot, giving you time to prepare passes. Running with the ball is tricky at first, as it doesn't stick to your foot the way it did in contemporary football games. Complex moves such as overhead kicks, back-heels and long-range through-ball passes can be completed with practice.</desc>

		<name>Killed Until Dead</name>
		<desc>Killed Until Dead is a sophisticated mystery game with a leaning towards humor. The player has to solve every aspect of a murder case before it happens. The five biggest mystery writers in the world have gathered together at a hotel and one of them will be offing another unless Hercule Holmes can crack the case. Gameplay is a cross between the board-game Clue and the paper-based logic puzzles in which the player must eliminate clues in sequence. To solve the forthcoming murder, you will have to search the suspects' rooms and confront them with the evidence and set the hotel's security cameras to record secret meetings. By questioning the suspects as to what they know about certain people, rooms and objects, they may reveal combinations they know will not be involved in the murder - perhaps if it involves the gun, the killer will not be Lord Peter Flimsey, for example. However, there's a catch. If he accuses the wrong suspect, he might be the one who's Killed Until Dead - they don't take kindly to false accusation.</desc>

		<name>Killerball</name>
		<desc>In the dark future the new brutal sports game will be invented - Killerball - a blend of American Football, Roller-Skating, and Pinball. The three leagues (Elite, Major and Minor) will differ by the level of brutality. The action takes place in a circular rink. Each team of five players should put the iron ball in the small hole of the opposite team to make a score, and do not allow the players of another team to make the same. Each team player has health indicator, which will decrease during the game, because the only way to take the ball is to knock down the opponent in any brutal way. Each match during the season has time limit, but it may be finished also if all the players of any team will be unconscious and at least one ball will be put in the hole. The game has a training mode, where you may play a single match with a computer or another human player, and tournament mode, where eight teams controlled either by computer or human players will fight for the victory. Tournament progress may be saved and restored.</desc>

		<path>./Killer Gorilla (Europe).zip</path>
		<name>Killer Gorilla</name>
		<desc>Killer Gorilla is a four stage platform game set on a building construction site. Stages consist of girders, ladders, conveyor belts and elevators. The object of stages one, two and three is to reach the top of the screen where your girlfriend is guarded by the eponymous Killer Gorilla. On stage four the objective is to remove the rivets from the girders, causing the top of the building to collapse and the gorilla to fall. On all stages, items belonging to your girlfriend can be collected for extra points. When stage four is completed, play loops back to stage one. Killer Gorilla is a clone of Nintendo's Donkey Kong arcade game. On stage one, the gorilla rolls barrels down the screen. These can be avoided, jumped over, or smashed with a hammer that can be collected and carried for a short time. If a barrel reaches the flaming barrel at the bottom of the screen, it will sometimes become a fireball that rolls erratically along girders and up and down ladders. On stage two, conveyor belts that occasionally change direction carry trays of cement that are fatal to the touch. Fireballs appear from a central furnace. Ladders to the top level extend and retract. There is again a hammer that can be used to smash the fireballs and the cement trays. On stage three, the gorilla throws bouncing I-beams that must be avoided. Constantly moving elevators must be jumped on to progress. On stage four, eight rivets hold the top of the building together. Running or jumping over each rivet makes it disappear. When all eight rivets have been removed, the stage is complete, and the game loops back to stage one, speeding up and adding barrels and cement trays.</desc>

		<desc>Knight Games consists of eight self-contained small games with a medieval theme. Two are shooting games. The Crossbow event involves moving a crosshair so as to hit one of an array of rotating targets. Once you've mastered this you are ready for Archery - this time you must hit targets which move from left to right, so timing is more important. The other six involve one-on-one combat. There are two sword-fighting battles against different backdrops; in each of them you must make 10 hits to get your opponent down, and do that 10 times to win overall. Time your jabs and shields to achieve this. The other four events follow the same formula, but with slightly different weapons. The Quartermast event is on a log, although the action is still only 2-dimensional. Ball &amp;amp; Chain, Axe and Pike battles complete the set. All can be played by 2 human players.</desc>

		<desc>Our hero must reach Melkhior, a somewhat eccentric wizard who is the only one who can save him. As with most Ultimate titles of the day, reaching him is a long and treacherous challenge, involving both puzzle-solving and action, meaning that each screen requires thorough planning and precise navigation. The game uses the isometric viewpoint in a manner similar to the later Head Over Heels, using monochrome but detailed graphics and techniques to avoid flickering sprites. The game lasts for 40 days and nights - at night your character turns into a werewolf. Ultimate's individual style of eschewing straightforward instuctions in favour of feature lists and riddles is put to good use here, with the story detailed in a rhyming poem of sorts.</desc>

		<name>Knight Tyme</name>
		<desc>After rescuing the wizard Gimbal, the Magic Knight finds himself transported into the 25th century aboard the peaceful trade starship USS Pisces. He must find a way back to his own time. Knight Tyme is the third game of the Magic Knight series. As in Spellbound, the previous game, the player interacts with the environment through the "Windimation" system: pressing a button brings up a window with a list of commands (pick up/drop/take/give an object, examine, command a character, read something, cast a spell and wear/unwear object). The player can scroll through these with the movement keys, and execute them with the same button used before. Spaceflight is part of the gameplay as the ship must visit several different planets. The spaceship has to be refueled, otherwise the character will be stuck forever in space. There are rooms that kill the knight instantaneously. Usually there is a puzzle associated with these rooms that must be solved in order to access them.</desc>

		<name>Knightmare</name>
		<desc>Knightmare was a popular childrens' television programme set in a medieval fantasy world, in which 3 players guided a fourth through a maze using a virtual reality system. In the first licensed game you have been trapped in Damonia Castle and must somehow escape. Viewed in 3D, you move your character around the rooms, while most other actions are activated using a verb-noun command system. By pressing the first letter of the first word (open, close, dig and so on) and pressing enter once you've got the right word, you can then choose the second word (options are context-sensitive; for example 'door' only appears if you stand near one). Plenty of puzzles must be solved along the way. Two advisers are present, one good and one bad, but each time you call for advice only one will answer, and you have to work out for yourself whether the clue is kosher. Your health is indicated by a candle graphic, the higher this is the healthier you are. You start without weaponry or spells, but these can be collected and used, including a rain cloud to freeze everything, Casper the magic key, and a cast-iron anvil to crush all evil.</desc>

		<name>Kobyashi Naru</name>
		<desc>Split into knowledge, wisdom and understanding sections, the Kobyashi Naru trial must be completed in order to gain immortal status. Collect the required objects from each one in this adventure game. The game offers pictures of each location and significant objects, and a textual description of each location, but beyond this the game system is atypical of 1980s adventures, especially those originating on cassette. A set of icons is displayed in the top half of the screen, which are selected to activate movement, item manipulation, analysing the scene (by selecting specific words of text), and actions like ascending, throwing and swimming. Puzzle solving always uses objects either in the scene description or your inventory.</desc>

		<name>Kokotoni Wilf</name>
		<desc>Kokotoni Wilf has been sent on a bold journey through time, to recover the seven pieces of the Dragon Amulet. There are 63 screens across 6 times zones to trek through in order to find these star-like objects. These screens are viewed from the side, and resemble Jet Set Willy, except that Wilf can fly through them and hover at a precision point. With hazards ranging from dinosaurs to spears to spaceships, and pieces located in hard-to-reach places, you will need this extra skill, especially as you have no weaponry. Most screens have more than 2 exits, but some are dead ends or lead directly into hazardous points. On each world you can immediately access the first 3 screens.</desc>

		<name>Ping Pong</name>
		<desc>From Konami's coin-op, Ping Pong recreates the fast-paced sport of table tennis. To win each match you must get to 10 points with a 2 point lead - if the scores reach 10-9 the game goes on until someone has a 2 point lead or reaches 15, in a similar manner to tennis. There are nine skill levels to beat, with increasing abilities as the game goes on. The human player has the advantage of serving first, and as the serve reverses every five points, you are guaranteed to have more chances to serve than your opponent (remember the significance of 10 and 15 in the scoring). The points system rewards long rallies and large winning margins, as you get points for each hit, for each point won, and for each point of the winning margin.</desc>

In the first part, the player must climb to the top of five buildings and must defeat one of Kong's minions on each one. Throughout the level, the player must avoid barrels and fire balls, and activate levers to move platforms. The second part, which can only be accessed when the first one is completed, is a simple side-scrolling run 'n' gun game. While still avoiding barrels and other objects, the player must shoot at enemies. Finally, they have to defeat Kong and save the girl.</desc>

The Ancients abandoned the planet, leaving behind many different artifacts and ships, which you can loot. Send your droid to retrieve modules and try to figure out what the ancient technology is for. It could be batteries, shields or even weapons, to help you fight the trigger-happy saucers that want you dead. The game uses fractal graphics, the terrain is vast and detailed, and the story behind it is quite complex, considering the type of game.</desc>

		<desc>Arkanoid-style Breakout clone, which unlike most other similar games has the bat on the side of the screen (there is a left/right option) instead of at the bottom. There are a number of types of special bricks, but unlike e.g. Arkanoid, they do not fall towards the bat. Instead, when you hit a special brick, it flips to show a letter. E.g. E (Extend bat), C (Catch ball), M (Missile), B (Bomb, explodes when hit by ball, clearing a number of bricks) and X (Extra life). The enemies/obstacles are more varied than in Arkanoid. Some make the bat freeze, some actually chew and eat your ball and spit out the core back at you!</desc>

		<desc>A conversion of the arcade game of the same name, which itself is loosely based on a movie, Kung-Fu Master is a side scrolling action game for one or two players, who alternate turns. Mr. X has captured the pickpocket Sylvia and it is up to Thomas, a kung-fu master who owns a restaurant, to get her back. She is located on the top floor of Mr. X's castle and Thomas will need to fight his way to the top. Of course, this won't be easy as each floor has many opponents to get past and a floor boss at the end of each level. Thomas is able to move left and right, jump, duck, and punch and kick. Enemy projectiles such as knives can be kicked in the air to rebound them towards the enemy. On the top floor resides Mr. X himself.</desc>

		<desc>Dizzy must rescue four of his 'Yolkfolk' (groan) chums in this game, from Cuckoo Land, Ice Land, Cloud Land and Zak's Castle. Like Fast Food it doesn't directly resemble the main series of arcade adventures, instead being a single-screen action game, resembling Pengo. The basic idea is to move around a maze of blocks collecting fruit, but the twist in the style is that you push the blocks in the maze to kill or trap those enemies. After every level is completed a short bonus screen appears where more fruit can be collected. During play various other tokens are released, such as bonus points, a smart bomb and control reversal.</desc>

		<desc>Laser Squad is by the same designer as Microprose's classic X-Com: UFO Defense. It brings to the table an immersive gameplay environment as well as many innovative ideas that weren't available in any other game of the time. In Laser Squad you control a group of "marine"-like soldiers (and the occasional cyborg). Before taking them into battle, you must buy them weapons and armour with a predetermined amount of credits, taking into account the individual abilities of your squad. Unlike X-COM, the soldiers do not gain experience over time. There are 3 missions in turn - in The Assassins you must face down Sterner Regnix and his guards, Moonbase assault challenges you to destroy the OmniCorp database, and Rescue From the Mines eschews violence in favour of a rescue mission. These are viewed from above and progress in turns. Laser Squad also features a 2-player "hotseat"-type gaming option.</desc>

		<desc>Access' long line of golf simulations started with Leader Board. Hold down the fire button to set the pace, then press it for hook and slice if needed. Greens are sloped, so be sure to factor this in. Four 18-hole courses are provided, and a 4-round match can consist of any combination of these, with up to 4 players joining in. There are three skill levels - novice players just have to hit the ball at the right speed in the right direction with the right club. Amateurs must be precise with the snap, to set the desired level of hook or slice - conventional wisdom in golf is to work on eliminating it first, then adding it back in - while the professional level also adds wind fluctuations.</desc>

		<path>./League Challenge (Europe).zip</path>
		<name>League Challenge</name>
		<desc>An old-fashioned football management game, in which you take over one of 64 clubs and try to lead them to glory. The choice is fairly arbitrary, as you can rename the team, you always start in the lowest of the four divisions, and the kits aren't real-life. You start with only 11 players, and the maximum is 15, so you'll be keen to sign new players, and you get this opportunity after each match, when a player is offered, with his skill and form displayed. You can train your players to improve these skills, and sell players you don't rate highly. Matches are played out via a succession of short animations, in which the home side wears red and the away side blue. At full time you are told how many injuries were incurred. The league season features 15 matches, one against each team, with the top two teams gaining promotion.</desc>

Armed only with a sword and 'star knives', you must fight your way through countless henchmen and the occasional boss to complete your task. Levels include the forest, moat, inside and outside of the castle. These levels repeat as the seasons change. The gameplay is side scrolling. Kage's moves include the ability jump extremely high in the air, grab and climb trees, block and attack with his sword, and throw shuriken. The game can be challenging at times though because the player dies in one hit. 2-players are supported, but must take turns.</desc>

		<desc>This is the mother of The Sims. When you load the game for the first time and personalise it with your name you'll see a house with several rooms like a kitchen, living room, bed room, etc. After some time of waiting a little person will appear and check out the house with all its rooms to see if he likes it. If he likes it, he will move in shortly and bring his dog along with him. That's where the real "game" starts and thats what it will be like every time you'll load the game from then. You see the house and the little person living in it, doing all kinds of stuff people do in their daily routine. He'll cook, eat, feed his dog, read newspapers, watch TV and from time to time he will write you a letter to let you know what he feels or what things he misses. To keep it more gamelike, you can "talk" to him in form of typing commands like "feed dog". You can also play cards with him and send him food or a present. There is no aim in this game other than to interact with your LCP.</desc>

		<desc>The Amstrad CPC appears to be the only released version of Grandslam's original vision of a licensed Liverpool FC game (a Striker-style forced perspective 3D game surfaced for 16-bit systems in 1992, and a slightly simplified top-view version for C64 a year later). A human player must represent Liverpool, and can play either single 1 or 2 player matches or a full league. The second team always wears white. The English Division 1 teams of the time are included, with their 11 first-choice players named. Attendances are calculated, and goalscorers are recorded. The action is viewed side-on, and uses a power bar to affect the strength of passes and shots - two bars move along the bottom of the screen in sequence, and must be stopped as close together as possible to produce a good contact with the ball. The ball sticks to a player's foot. Players appear to occasionally freeze, and sometimes two players will get jammed together, and need a third to move the ball. The view is very close-up, but a scanner of the whole pitch is provided, as well as a running clock.</desc>

		<desc>The Bungeling Empire has stolen a huge cache of gold from its rightful owners, and your mission is to infiltrate its treasury and recapture it. This entails progressing through 150 screens of platforms, ladders and ropes. The Empire has sent robotic guards down to protect the gold, and contact with any of these will cost you a life. Your method of escaping them is to press fire to dig a hole in their line of movement, thus causing them to fall in briefly, allowing you to move across the gap safely. Once all the gold has been collected, a ladder allowing you to move onto the next screen is added. Completing these screens often requires forward planning and precision. This was one of the earliest games to include a level editor, allowing the creation of new level designs with no programming skill.</desc>

		<name>Loopz</name>
		<desc>A puzzle game where the main goal is to make loops! Random pieces are presented over a board, including simple lines and corners as well as S bends and other warped shapes, of varying sizes. It is up to the player to link them up in a loop form, then moving on to the next level. Pieces can be placed on any empty space on the grid, and rotated into one of the four main compass directions. Any pieces which are not part of the finished loop when a level is completed are left on the screen, so there is value in playing towards 2 distinct loops, to ensure that you have options depending on which pieces are drawn - unlike Pipe Dream there are no clues as to which pieces are coming next. Three play modes are available, two of which can be played with two players. Game A is freestyle - simply make loops, gaining extra points for size and style. Game B is about unlocking bonus boards of the game by reaching a certain score. and uses a bonus multiplier method depending on loop difficulty. The third mode of play begins with an already made loop and then removes random pieces of it, so the player has to put them back in when they appear again. It is essentially a memory test and logic puzzle of fitting the pieces back as one remembers - although placing a piece where it seems to fit is also often effective.</desc>

		<name>Lords of Chaos</name>
		<desc>Turn-based strategy game based on Julian Gollop's earlier games, Chaos and Laser Squad. The setting is pure fantasy - the Old World is wrecked by magical discharges, and the wizards who attempted to keep it balanced ultimately gave up, and used their skill to create a new world. These Lords of Chaos (up to four, played either by human or computer) may now battle for control of this world. The idea of the game is to escape the level within a certain number of moves (preferably carrying lot of treasure and having killed the evil wizard Torquemada). Along the way you can use wizardry weapons and spells (there are 45 in total, created by combining ingredients) to conjure up mystical creatures like dragons and unicorns, but unfortunately so can Torquemada. Worlds include marshlands, castles and forests.</desc>

		<name>Los Angeles SWAT</name>
		<desc>The streets of Los Angeles are not safe. Lately, the kids are sick and tired of parents ordering them about and telling them what to do, so they decide to go out on the streets and threaten to club every policeman who gets in their way, making the streets not safe for the public, not even for little old ladies who decide to take a walk on a sunny day. The bad news is: you're a police officer patrolling the streets, and you have two other police officers at your side. Your job is to shoot the little troublemakers that approach you. These troublemakers are harmless at a distance, but they are known to throw fire bombs at a few policemen. When you are killed by one of the troublemakers, one of the policemen replaces you as the one who gets to control the streets. If there is no policemen left, the game is over. There are also turret guns located on top of buildings that fire, so you just can't stay on the footpath and hope not to get clobbered by the troublemakers. You just have to cross the road which is dangerous for a policeman in situations like this. When you come to the intersection, you'll come face-to-face with a gang, and you must shoot each gang member before they have a chance to leave you for dead. Once you've shoot all remaining gang members, a man appears holding a woman hostage. The object here is to shoot the man to free her. If you shoot the woman instead, you'll sacrifice 1000 points. Your score increases when you walk, but score more points if you manage to shoot a troublemaker. You'll lose 100 points for killing a lady walking down the footpath.</desc>

		<name>Lotus Esprit Turbo Challenge</name>
		<desc>The first in a series of 3 racing games endorsed by the legendary car company, which is now a part of Proton. The game features a total of 32 fictitious racetracks from around the world, split into 3 difficulty levels. There are 19 computer opponents (15 on the 8-bit versions) and you have to finish in the top 10 (top 8 on the 8-bits) to progress. The higher you finish in one race, the lower down the grid you start for the next race. The opposition drivers have pun names based on the F1 drivers of the day - examples include Ricardo Pastry and Crashhard Banger. You can choose between sound effects or one of a variety of music pieces. The game features a simultaneous 2-player mode, but the 1-player mode only uses half the screen, a simple animation filling the other half. In most races you will have to make a pitstop for fuel in order to reach the finish. The tracks include features such as oil slicks, roadworks, boulders and rivers - contact with these (or the other cars) will slow you, but there is no car damage model.</desc>

		<desc>Mad Mix is a Pac-Man variant, with a typical bird's eye view for each level and pellets you must eat in order to get to the next stages. Navigate the maze you're trapped in and gobble up food while trying to avoid the ghosts that are chasing you. As a Pac-Man variant, there are some changes made to distinguish itself. Some levels offer transformative powers. These include being turned into a hippopotamus - which allows you to step on ghosts - and a vacuum cleaner - to clean up pellets corrupted by a wandering enemy. On some levels, you can also briefly turn the protagonist into a spaceship or a tank, where you can shoot ghosts from a fixed vantage point. As with most arcade titles at the time, there is no true ending; the game loops back to the first level when you finish the last one.</desc>

		<name>Madballs</name>
		<desc>On the planet Orb live a gang of notorious Madballs who decide what is passed through parliament. They have no leader, and this is where a ball simply known as Dust Brain comes in. It is his quest to persuade the other Madballs on the planet to join him in his quest for power, and he does this by bumping them off the multi-directionally scrolling platforms. Once a Madball has been persuaded, it appears in a tube at the bottom of the screen. When a Madball ends up in the tube, Dust Brain must find the 'downtube' exit so that he can pursue other Madballs. While searching for other Madballs, Dust Brain encounters many obstacles that include trampolines, springboards, catapults, ramps, pyramids, and oil slicks; and these obstacles can either help or hinder Dust Brain. Each platform has its own dustbin, and if Dust Brain bounces over this, he changes into a Madball already in the tube. Also, he will make contact with three bureaucrats who will make his task harder, but they can also be pushed of the edge of platforms, giving Dust Brain plenty of time to bounce around before the bureaucrats have the chance to resurrect themselves. Each Madball has its own speed and strength, and it can be difficult for a strong Madball to fall off a platform. Each of them also have their own energy source, which include cabbages, fish heads, bones, and Coke. When eight Madballs have been persuaded, this tube is full. When the active Madball falls off the platform, another one takes its place. When the last Madball in the tube falls off the platform, his quest for power has failed.</desc>

		<desc>An alien menace has attacked the worlds of civilization and laid waste to their planets. However before the being conquered, a group of scientists has managed to create one last weapon and hidden it underground. The name of the weapon is Mag Max and only it might be able to defeat the alien invaders. Mag Max however is incomplete and for security reasons, his component parts are scattered across the land. Through their collection, Mag Max's strength increases. Mag Max is a side-scrolling shooter game. At the beginning, Mag Max is only a tiny little fighter craft that can fire low-powered projectiles. As component pieces are found; such as a head, legs and a laser lance, Mag Max's offensive power increases. Access to the underworld can be granted through small dark craters on the landscape. Once in the underworld, Mag Max's weapons vary slightly as do the enemies (there are no stationary objects underground). Enemy fire or contact on each of the components will destroy that component. Fire on the main fighter will destroy Mag Max. At the end of each level awaits a boss creature.</desc>

They are not the kind of people anyone would allow to run freely through the streets. Once inside the camp, the first action will consist in cornering the four captains, to snatch each of their codified cards. Simultaneously, it's necessary to find two security computers: one opens the door of the subterranean base and the other allows access to the control room. Finally, you should arrive at this room and activate the missiles with the cards. You will then need to leave the base.</desc>

		<name>Marble Madness Construction Set</name>
		<desc>Marble Madness involved guiding a ball through precarious levels with drops, ramps, and enemies to avoid for fear of losing time or being sent back to the start of a screen. The initial home licensing was split  Electronic Arts converted the arcade game itself to several systems, whilst Melbourne House provided their own level set, but more significantly designed an environment allowing players to create their own levels. Angled and slanted ramps can be placed anywhere, either on a blank screen or to edit an existing level. Enemies can be placed anywhere, these will follow their own paths once you play the game. Time / points bonuses and oil slicks can also be added to the levels. A complete block of levels can be saved to create a game set of its own. Designs can be tested out before being committed to storage.</desc>

Crabs, turtles and fighter flies must be cleared out by jumping underneath the platform they sit on, then kicking them away. Each level is cleared when a set number of coins is collected.

		<desc>Marsport is the first (and ultimately only) game in an unfinished trilogy set in the 25th century. Humanity is at war with the Sept alien race, and they are now in a position to invade Earth, as they have the plans for their protective sphere. You play John Marsh, a soldier turned leader who must go to Mars and locate the original plans. Marsport uses the same game system as Tir Na Nog and Dun Darach, although a 3D effect is incorporated into the graphics. A single path is displayed on screen at a time, and the view is rotated at junctions. The Warriors and Warlords must be shot down using weaponry, making this Gargoyle's most action-driven adventure up to this point. The Marsport is split into ten distinct sections with their own functions, such as Stores, Administration and Computers. There are robots to interact with, for gaining information or objects. Pairs of objects can be combined to manufacture new ones. A central computer locks out many sections until it can be found and disabled. You will have to shoot the Sept before they can touch you, and also be wary of Warden robots which may malfunction and mistake you for a Sept.</desc>

		<name>Mask</name>
		<desc>MASK is game based on a popular animated TV series of the mid 1980's. In addition to the TV series, entitled M.A.S.K., an acronymn for Mobile Armored Strike Kommand, there was also a series of books, authored by Kenneth Harper and illustrated by Bruce Hogarth, and comics. A new line of toys was produced to accompany each TV series. The stories all centre around the M.A.S.K. organisation led by the fearless Matt Tracker. M.A.S.K. agents wear helmets or masks to protect their identities and to give them super powers which help in their fight against the criminal V.E.N.O.M. organisation. They drive super powered vehicles which can transform. V.E.N.O.M., aka the Vicious Evil Network of Mayhem, are the bad guys. They are by Miles Mayhem one time friend of Matt and co-founder of MASK who betrayed Matt long ago. There are four areas to the game and in all Matt must drive his Thunderhawk vehicle around the game area, avoiding V.E.N.O.M.'s armoured vehicles and tanks while accomplishing tasks in a specific order. In area 1 : Boulder Hill, his first task is to recover his own mask and later an abducted agent. However it's not just a case of driving around until the agent is found. Matt must first and collect a scanner which will direct him the missing agent (who will be hidden). However the agent cannot be picked up until his mask has been collected and the scanner will not function until the four pieces of the security key have been collected and assembled. Items, including bombs, are collected by driving over them. Bombs are Matt's only weapon against V.E.N.O.M.'s tanks and, as bombs do, they will damage Matt and his vehicle if he's too close to the explosion. The remainder of the game consists of three more areas, Prehistoric, Far Future, and VENOM Base each of which have two abducted agents to rescue.</desc>

Firstly, you must ride a magic carpet, flying through a series of diamonds which twists and turns more as you move through the 41 levels. Alternating with this, you are in front of a row of pipes. Hit a gong 3 times to summon a genie, who will play a sequence of notes. Once the last one has been played, they fly towards you in order, and their colour equivalent on the row must be hit (the number of times they are played), before the flying note can hurt you. Complete this and a piece of lamp is granted.</desc>

		<name>Mata Hari</name>
		<desc>Super spy MATA HARI (also known as an exotic/erotic dancer and courtesan) has just entered the embassy, where the double agent WALLS is prisoned under high surveillance. It is necessary that you help her because her mission is perilous. She will have to eliminate one after another all security guards (humans and robots) by shooting them from her pistol, avoid flying robo-droids by standing in doggy-style pose, and acquire the number of secret code for the electronic doors by threatening the embassy employees. Queen of explosive, she will have to collect the dynamites scattered within embassy and blow up the strong doors and safes, where diskettes (CPC) / keys (ST) are hidden, which allow to reach the upper floors by the elevator. Every wrong move of MATA HARI means her coma and every coma of MATA HARI throws her into embassy's hospital, from where she may exit optionally (in Amstrad CPC version) or fighting with a guard (in Atari ST version).</desc>

		<name>Match Day II</name>
		<desc>The original Match Day was the first serious football game to hit the Spectrum, and this sequel emerged over 2 years later. League and Cup tournaments for up to 8 teams (any or all of which can be human-controlled) are offered alongside one-off Friendly matches with a handicap option - passcodes are given to allow you to restore these to the same state another day. Matches are seven-a-side, with variable lengths from 10 to 30 minutes. All kicks except set pieces are variable in strength using a Kick-o-meter which is displayed on screen. One revolutionary feature of the game was the Diamond Deflection System, which mathematically calculated the angle and pace of any rebounds.</desc>

		<path>./Max Headroom (Europe).zip</path>
		<name>Max Headroom</name>
		<desc>This game is based on a 1984 British television movie which led to a 14-episode television series that ran in 1987 in the U.S. It's an early cyberpunk vision set "twenty minutes in the future" where powerful corporations rule and compete for television ratings and consumer dollars. Edison Carter is an investigative reporter for Network 23 seeking to free his alter ego Max Headroom, a cybernetic construct of his mind that was stored after Edison was involved in a motorcycle accident and the last thing he saw before losing consciousness was a "Max Headroom" sign going into a tunnel. Max lives in computers and can appear on any screen, television or any electronic device. The character is actually Matt Frewer in a latex mask, edited so as to appear jittery and stuttering like an early computer model. In the game, Max has been abducted by Network 23 and you must retrieve him from somewhere in the 11 top floors of their high-rise building starting at the 200th floor. Security systems protect each floor and you have to find and enter the correct codes to gain access from the elevators. Each floor seen in isometric view, has lines representing walls of various rooms with doors and office furniture. Robots will chase and fire at you and decrease your health level as shown on the biomonitor at bottom of screen. Also indicated are the floor number and time left. On the right side of screen are 4 icons for Reporter E. Carter which open a door, call elevator, view through camera, or allow movement to run around the floor. On the left side are icons for Controller T. Jones (Theora helps you hack into systems) to show you the floor and computer circuits. When entering a security code, it takes the form of an LED digit over which you must move a pointer over a row of circuit lines in order to activate various segments to form a desired digit. Each segment will remain lit only temporarily so when time runs out you must ensure that the letter is fully lit or your code will fail. In that event, you must make your way across the floor to the second elevator and try again.</desc>

		<name>Mega Phoenix</name>
		<desc>Mega Phoenix brings the concept of the earlier arcade game Phoenix into the 90s, to the extent that a coin-op version was later made by Gaelco. The game is a single-screen shoot em up in which the player moves left to right while shooting several waves. There is a shield function available, which lasts for a short period of time (after which it must recharge to be used again) and it paralyses the craft while active. The first waves consist of several small alien beings in a set pattern, which move down from the fleet towards the player at random intervals- contacts with these kills the player. Deadly phoenixes firing at you come next, followed by the Mega Phoenix itself and then a final boss, before it all repeats with higher difficulty.</desc>

		<desc>It is a very strange universe really - isn´t it? All those millions of planets and moons and stars and comets swirling about in the vastness of space. Imagine what fun it would be to explore - to boldly go where no boldly goer had boldly gone before - unless they happened to live there. Latest research from the Institute of Advanced Research (I.A.R.) indicated that there are quite a lot of planets with things living on them. Some of these things are pretty intelligent like us really. Other of these things are really stupid, like whelks, for example. Anyway, to cut a long story short, you have been selected to explore the universe, boldly seeking out strange and exciting new worlds. If you find any, your instructions are quite clear. BLAST THE LIVING DAYLIGHTS OUT OF THEM!!</desc>

Finding strategic placings is important, especially as you can't shoot while on water. Most of the time you are on foot, but at times you can hijack vehicles of shot foes.

You drive a tank which moves under heavy inertia via directional controls, and bumps into walls and can only shoot. Gameplay resembles titles such as Alien 8 and Sweevo's World. Some blocks can be pushed, some move after you shoot them, while some can be used for lifts. Most rooms have multiple exits, but some are locked and others aren't on the same vertical level. Avoid lasers and blocks, solve puzzles by pushing or triggering blocks, and finally solve your quest.</desc>

		<name>Miami Vice</name>
		<desc>In this spin-off from a popular TV cop show of the 1980s, Crockett and Tubbs are trying to smash a drugs ring bossed by Mr. J. You have to start at the bottom, initially busting the casual dealers before reaching their suppliers, and ultimately the casino-dwelling honchos. This is done through a combination of driving and shooting, through an overhead rendition of Miami. When crooks are stopped they will often provide valuable information, although sometimes they can only be stopped by shooting them. When you learn of a meeting, you can enter it on foot, either to gain evidence or make an arrest - but remember that a joint full of crooks will not simply allow you to do your civic duty. This is all done against a time limit, with a one-minute penalty for crashing the car.</desc>

		<name>Mickey Mouse: The Computer Game</name>
		<desc>The Ogre King and his minions have taken over Disney Castle, and it's Mickey's task to win it back. The game starts on a sequence of stairways, up which Mickey must move, shooting any creatures that get in his way. Eventually you will come to a door and go through it, at which point the second section of the game begins. These are viewed from above, and see Mickey negotiate his way through a multi-screen maze, with multiple exits on each screen. Ghosts and ogres block his path, but he's armed with a water pistol for the former and an axe for the latter, both of which need replenishing regularly. Some doors require keys to move through. There are several sub-games, including Pac-Man and Donkey Kong-derived games. To win the game you must finally beat the Ogre King.</desc>

You must have very warm nerves, very cold head and especially the most prepared to pull the trigger. Mike Gunner is a shooting-gallery Operation Wolf-style game, requiring the Gun Stick accessory. The player will have to adjust the contrast and brightness of your screen, in order to gain optimum performance. Thorough the game you will find people who shouldn't shot at: for example kids or policemen, all of them easily identifiable. But be careful, others will appear disguised as peaceful musicians, and in the least expected moment they will show they are not so friendly.</desc>

		<name>Mike Read's Computer Pop Quiz</name>
		<desc>BBC Radio 1 DJ Mike Read presented a pop music quiz show, which is recreated here with questions from the 50s to the 80s. You can play against the computer or another human; either way, select a specialist subject and 2 team-mate graphics (all representing white people). The overall style and presentation are very similar to Elite's earlier A Question of Sport license. In the first round you select one of twelve random questions from the Jukebox, each of which has four options. A correct answer earns you two points, while an incorrect answer gives your opponent the chance to steal for one point. In round 2 you get three clues to name a star - you get three points for guessing from one clue, two points from two, and one point if you need all 3. In round three, choose an Easy question (from your category) for one point, or a Hard one (from someone else's) for two. Round four asks you to Guess The Year that a set of events happened in, with scoring the same as round 2. Then comes the quickfire round - answer up to nine questions in 45 seconds, with a 2-second penalty for an incorrect answer. Finally, the six remaining Jukebox pictures are revealed and answered.</desc>

		<path>./Mikie (Europe).zip</path>
		<name>Mikie</name>
		<desc>Mikie puts you in charge of Mikie, a high school student who likes to win hearts of every girl that he can lay his eyes on. There are several classrooms to explore like the Quantum Physics Room, Locker Room, Canteen, the Aerobics Dancing Class, and the Playground. In each classroom, Mikie has to collect all the hearts that are found in each classroom to form a message. In order to collect these hearts, Mikie must stand somewhere near them and shout out. There are two type of hearts: small and large. Mikie needs to shout out only once to collect the small hearts, and multiple times to collect the large ones. When a message is formed, Mikie can exit the classroom through a door marked OUT. Stopping him from collecting the hearts is the teacher, the chef, and the janitor. The teacher is the worst one. When he is unable to catch you, he works up a sweat, and eventually, throws his teeth at you. When his teeth hits Mikie, he loses one of his three lives. In later classrooms, Mikie can throw stuff at his enemies in order to stun them for several seconds (for instance, the basketballs in the locker room, and the chickens in the canteen). The janitor isn't as bad because he walks much slower than the others. In between levels, you have to enter the next classroom through a door marked IN without being caught, but you can do at least two things to pass time: Steal some lunch, and open one of the unmarked doors to receive a punch, a kick, or the chance to see a naked lady with breasts. Beware that if you take too long in the hallway and don't travel between floors, a bucket slides across the screen real fast and attempt to slip you. If you're good enough at the game, you can enter a high score, and if you fail to enter anything, the game will assume that you are Clint Eastwood.</desc>

		<name>Mindtrap</name>
		<desc>This abstract puzzler promises 999,999 different levels, with a game design bearing some relation to sliding-block games. You are presented with up to 24 coloured and spotted (like dice) blocks, arranged in columns of up to 4. The task is to arrange these so that they are lined up in columns matching their number. You are in control of a crosshair, which can be moved to cover four blocks. Holding fire while pushing left or right and hovering it over a group of 4 will move the four blocks around in sequence. Things can get harder when the level arrangement results in blocks having to be moved through sections with a column of only 2, or when some parts of the arena lack cogs, meaning that you can't move on those sections. Later in the game you'll have to work on multiple floors at the same time, switching blocks between them.</desc>

		<name>Mindfighter</name>
		<desc>The computer game of an Anna Popkess book (which was originally bundled with the game) uses an interactive fiction System Without A Name, or SWAN for short. Its set in a post-apocalyptic world of guards desperately attempting to retain order over mobs of genetically-mutated thugs, with extensive use of the death penalty. Into this maelstrom steps Robin, an 11-year-old psychic beamed forward in time from before the drama. Adjusting to a completely different form of life, Robin must learn to survive and get adequate food, and ultimately infiltrate this vicious police state. Encounters with other characters are frequent, of whom some retain a semblance of old humanity. Daryl, Alison and Matthew all come in handy, and must be coaxed into doing what you wish. Examining objects often gives few clues, so the detail in the manual is vital, although few of the objects are vastly different from familiar 20th century artifacts. Two levels of object descriptions exist, allowing for faster or more immersive play.</desc>

Reaching the room itself is no easy task, as the hotel is split into segments of 8 floors, and you cant move onto the next one without the emergency key, which the porter has hold of  he must be located. Each of these has one eighth of the secret stop code, and these must be entered in order to finally diffuse the bomb. Secrets can be gleaned from the opposing hijackers, and from the barman.

		<desc>As man in some sort of hand-made bike/helicopter you are flying down into the catacombs of some French town. These catacombs formed a labyrinth are filled with flowers, acid cans and are controlled by your enemies representing dinosaurs, mutants, robots, and undeads. The contact with enemies is lethal for you, so you have to find the flowers of appropriate color, and shoot the balls of such color at the monsters of such color to kill them. Also you should clear your way of acid cans. To do this you should most often fly to appropriate position of complex labyrinth to shoot the can through the gap in the wall. It is because of your ability to shoot in horizontal plane only. To increase your energy you should find the barbecues.</desc>

		<name>Molecule Man</name>
		<desc>Molecule Man is trapped inside a radioactive maze of 256 screens, and it's your job to get him out. To do this you must collect 16 circuits which are located at extreme points of the levels. You must regularly consume radiation tablets to fend off certain poisoning, and your initial supply of 20 is totally inadequate. Fortunately, there are coins dotted around the levels, as well as ant-radiation tablet vending machines at which you can buy them. Coins can also be used to buy more time, or to blow up obstacles which make some sections difficult or impossible to access. Viewed isometrically, the screen designs are intentionally surreal, each taking on an unlikely distorted real-world theme. If you find the initial level layouts too easy, too hard or too dull, you can design a new set with the bundled maze editor.</desc>

Like the original, the game is a flick-screen platformer with puzzly leanings. Learning the movement paths of enemies, and the timing sequence of the crushers, and working out a path across the screen by using the offered ropes and platforms. Not all parts of all screens can be accessed at once. You will need to collect money and other items along the way. Before starting the game, you must choose five items from a selection of 21 to form your 'Freedom Kit'  correct selections are essential to complete the game, and a degree of trial and error is required to know which ones are correct.</desc>

And so you have travelled to England to test your detective skills. As the story begins, you are outside Tresyllian Castle - the old, dark, hauntingly beautiful castle where Tamara now lives. Tamara greets you, and you meet some interesting guests. But your visit soon turns to mystery, as a trail of riddles and clues leads you to a hidden valuable treasure. But Tamara is worried about a ghost that is tormenting her. What does the ghost want? Is it jealous of her? Does the ghost want the hidden treasure for itself? Or is the ghost a fake - just someone dressing up to frighten Tamara? If so, why? Some of the characters in the game will treat you differently whether you play as a male or female character, and the game comes with four different variations (choosen at the start by picking a color).

One day you encounter an old man named Mordon, who explains that he is one of the Ancient Ones, who have been guiding universes in a positive way for centuries. However, they have been dying out through old age, and so have built a time machine. A younger Ancient One named Bostafer scuppered this, destroying the machine in the hope of using it to make himself immortal. Can you retrieve all the pieces from time and space before Bostafer?The pieces have attained mythical status in some cultures, so retrieving them may not be an easy task. Mordon's Quest is a pure-text IF game containing 150 locations and understanding over 400 words. Items you will find early in the game include a blowpipe, a black pearl and a crystal orb. Commands include CLIMB, SACRIFICE and INSERT, as well as standard movement and object-retrieval methods.</desc>

		<desc>The feel of a gangster movie is recreated isometrically in this game. You play a private detective who has the task of retrieving a vital cassette from a Mob boss' hideout. Two twin girls are in the area - one is on your side, the other is connected to the mob. Needless to say, you will have to work out who you can trust. You control the detective with either directional (key or joystick press corresponds to motion) or rotational (forward to move, left or right to rotate) control. Pressing fire activates the main command menu, which allows you to pick up or drop objects, use your gun, and communicate with people. You can carry 3 items at a time; a command exists to swap between them.</desc>

		<name>Mutan Zone</name>
		<desc>Scorpio was one of the most beautiful space colonies of all the galaxy and its raw materials were one of the fundamental points of the terrestrial wealth. But, one day, the explosion of a Supernova altered the genes of the inhabitants of the planet, turning them into strange beings who hate the human specie and want to destroy it. In such a situation, the Earth space services sent a series of scientists in order to study the mutation and the way for solving it. But they were captured and forced to work for the scorpians in the creation of a definitive weapon that would make disappear our planet of the Solar System. Only a Rainbow-Command could avoid it and your help will be indispensable for the attainment of the mission. The game is composed of two parts, within which there are two introduction sub-games that will allow you to obtain some additional lives before starting the game itself. On the first part you will have to face a series of natural obstacles while shooting to everything with strange looks, for that, you count with a laser and a cosmic hammer, but you also should take batteries for your portable radar that informs to you of the enemy situation. Once finished this part, you will start the last one, in which you must be careful in not crashing your newly-acquired motorcycle with the multiple obstacles you will find, at the same time you get rid of the mutants, whereas you go to the laboratory where you will have to liberate the kidnapped scientists. It won't be easy - you will find the head of the mutants who is anxious to give you a warm welcome.</desc>

		<desc>In the distant future, human beings have outposts all over the galaxies, but wars and aggression have not died out. Neither has opposition to potential exploitation or environmental damage; your resistance movement has discovered that Macro-Genetic Mutoids (Mutants) are being bred purely to be used as weapons. Controlling the familiarly-named Rainbow Warrior in this top-view shooter, you must fly to each of the 15 mutant-breeding zones, collecting their self-destruct pods, and taking all of these to the control room. You are armed with missiles, torpedos and a shield, and can use one of these at a time. The control zone is hazardous, and any contact is destructive, but reaching its target will recharge your three lives; thus, it can be worth doing this before you have completed all 15 zones. The gameplay element of having short levels with a single specific target to account for resembles Hunter's Moon.</desc>

		<name>Myth : History in the Making</name>
		<desc>In this platform game, you are a mere mortal who has been called by the Gods to defeat several mythological creatures that have been turned bad by the evil Dameron. Myth: History in the Making is a platform game with a lot of fighting. The levels of this game deal with different mythologies, from ancient Greece to the Vikings, over to Valhalla (where none other than the hammer-wielding Thor awaits you), and more. Apart from jumping from platform to platform, you'll also fight the enemies and bosses in your path with a variety of weapons - in the beginning you have only fists to defend yourself, but later you'll find more powerful weapons, such as swords and axes. There are many various types of enemies, different on every level. Typically, enemies keep appearing and coming at you from all sides, no matter how many of them you kill - so you have to keep moving. Some obstacles in the game require not only brute force, but also a bit of thinking and puzzle-solving (and guesswork) to get past.</desc>

		<desc>Cyrus T. Gross has built the TALOS asteroid and directed it towards earth. Only the Nemesis Organisation's Mobile Attack Droid 471 can save humanity now. In N.O.M.A.D., players take control of the Mobile Attack Droid 471 as it ventures through the city, in this top-view shooter. Players begin with four lives. The Droid moves with considerable inertia (although some rooms disable this), and control involves using left and right to rotate it, pushing forward to provide thrust in the direction it is facing, and pushing backwards to reverse. The early part of the route is linear, but later on there are junctions to plan around. Moving enemies, spawning points and wall-mounted guns are the main threats. There are many switches along the walls, which open the sealed doors located throughout the levels, although a switch doesn't automatically operate on the nearest door. The game features regular checkpoints, which will restore the droid to that point after the lose a life. Points are awarded constantly for survival, and for shooting the enemies and other targets.</desc>

And when the Yhóp-Uthas were not busy breaking necks and burning houses, the Kah-Vronn-Azhos were, or the Tuj-Muer-Tso-Tsó, or even the Myby Ka-Gahn-Tó? Nobody seemed to take Nanako?s village seriously, so Nanako decided that the situation had to change. The first thing Nanako did was getting incredibly angry and stomp forcefully her feet against the floor but, as such relieving action didn't solve a thing, she decided to go see the Oracle. The guy, of inmense wisdom, advised her to go to Hell to look for 4 pieces of an ancient artifact which would turn to ashes any offender tribe which would attack the village. Nanako didn't find that strange at all (we all know that in Hell you can find such kind of things), so she took her way down to Hell!</desc>

		<name>NARC</name>
		<desc>Narc is a 1-2 player game, where your mission is to infiltrate the Mr. Big Corporation, the scourge of the underworld. To do this, you must get through the game's eight stages, with over ten sectors like the junkyard, subway, drug lab, nursery, downtown, Sunset Strip, and even the corporation, where Mr. Big resides. In order to get through the stages, you are required to collect a number of safe cards, and insert them in the slot next to the stage exit. Each sector includes a map, and should be easy to read. For example, the blue or red dots represent you, and the white dots are the missile launchers, while the "E" indicates the exit. Your mission ain't going to be easy, as you will come face-to-face with enemies including the canine mutts, Das Lof Gang, Dr. Spike Rush, Joe Rockhead, Kinky Pinky, Sgt. Skyhigh, HQ Posse, and Mr. Big himself. You have two ways you can deal with them: either put a bullet in them or make arrests. Furthermore, they will try to blow you up the minute they see you. Fortunately, you're armed with a shotgun and missile launcher, but these both have a limited supply of ammunition. If your bullet counter reaches one, you can only fire one bullet at a time, so you need to find some more. Also, it is important not to waste all of your missiles: you might need them later when you deal with later enemies like Mr. Big. You are also backed up by a chopper and a mean shiny street machine. More often than not, when you blow up enemies, you can pick up several items that they drop, including drugs, money, ammunition, missile launchers, and if you're lucky, safe cards. Even if you got the safe card and can pass the level, you can keep blowing up enemies to score more points. According to the game, this game is for training purposes only, so you will not get employed by your local DEA office. Is this what the DEA does every day: go on rampages?</desc>

The game plays like a strategic third person shooter. You control the commander of the current squad, and can switch between the three.

Upon returning to the EPIC's home base of Altontron, the crew became aware that the ship had been infected by the alien life form. They have sent an android called NEIL to get rid of the aliens. Each room of the ship contains nine green aliens that NEIL needs to destroy. As well as these aliens, there are also robots that come in the room from time to time. When shot, these robots leave behind cells, which give NEIL extra ammunition, allow him to replenish his air supply, or use a smart bomb which kills all aliens in the room. Finding a turbo lift allows NEIL to travel between floors.</desc>

The game is set on a succession of 30 single-screen levels comprising of networks of platforms. You are armed with a gun (with limited ammunition) and a sword, and must kill a set amount of Terminators on each level. Terminators follow a set pattern, so you can work out which ledges they will reach next. Dead Terminators remain on the screen - when you are not doing well, Torquemata can sometimes turn these into vicious scythe-wielding zombies.</desc>

		<desc>Nether Earth is arguably the first classic real time strategy. In a distant future there is a war between humans and ancient race of aliens called Insignian. On mysterious planet there are four bases to conquer and to win a war - Kerberus, Tarras, Faretra and Diolkos. Only way, how to fight, is to use factories to build giant battle robots, similar to Mech units in other games. Commanding robots, capturing factories and defeating enemy in realtime - is primary goal for player. In Nether Earth is player controlling small flying robot, instead of mouse cursor in Dune 2 and later RTS games. With this robot you can enter a factory, design your unique battle robot from few parts like wheels, antigrav, radar, laser gun or nuclear weapon. After that you have to command your robot. Artifical Intelligence is great for a time, but in though times is possible to control robot manualy. Every captured factory means difference in tactics, because of power ballance. Computer AI has no advantage of you, its pure strategy in real time.</desc>

		<name>Nigel Mansell's Grand Prix</name>
		<desc>Nigel Mansell's first licensed computer game recreates all 16 Formula 1 circuits of the time, viewed from behind the car but with a full cockpit-type view below. This is important because the game is very much a simulation rather than an action game. Before each race you have to do three qualifying laps, and only make the grid if you are fast enough to meet the pre-defined qualifying limit. The races can be between 5 and 20 laps, or at full length if you prefer - fortunately a half-finished season can be saved to cassette or disk. F1 cars of this era have turbo boosts, and this is available in the game to provide a quick blast of extra speed, which is useful for overtaking but can cause the turbo or the engine itself to be overstressed, as well as using fuel more quickly (pitstops are for tires but not fuel, again in keeping with the era's real Formula 1 rules).</desc>

Time was that this area was safe and hospitable, however darkness then came - killing many of the inhabitants and warping the minds of the others. Many have gone there, none have returned - can you be the first? Nightshade is an arcade adventure in scrolling isometric 3D (an advance on earlier Ultimate titles such as Knight Lore, which were flick-screen), with directional or rotational controls. You can take 3 hits from the various roaming monsters - turning from white to yellow to green as you take them - but a 4th costs you one of your five lives. Objects can be thrown at these foes, but only if you have any. The map is made up of medieval-style buildings, which are visible while you are on the outside but whose roofs lift when you enter them, to ensure full visibility. There are four super-villains to destroy (a mad monk, a skeleton, a ghost, and Mr Grimreaper), and you must find the right objects to do this.</desc>

As the Ninja's took damage their classic Ninja garb was torn away to reveal robotic limbs, torso or head. When the damage reached critical the Ninja Robot would explode, scattering mechanical body parts. As with The Sales Curve's later title SWIV, The Ninja Warriors used the company's Dynamic Loading System to load sprites, sound and background graphics from disk on the fly.</desc>

		<name>Nodes of Yesod</name>
		<desc>Strange signals are coming from the moon and Charlemagne Fotheringham-Grunes (or Charlie for short), member of the International Commission for Universal Problem Solving (I.C.U.P.S.) is sent to investigate. It turns out that the source of the signals is a strange monolith. The aim of the game is to destroy this monolith. Nodes of Yesod is an Arcade Adventure seen from a side-scrolling perspective. Charlie can jump and, after finding it first, use a device called mole. After pressing up on on the joystick, Charlie stands still and the player gains control over the mole that can be used to attack enemies. However, not all enemies can be harmed by the mole. Another useful device is the burrowing chum that can be used to dig through certain walls. Before Charlie can reach the monolith, he has to explore the many caverns of the moon and find eight keys or alchiems. Every now and then a red spaceman will show up, and touching him will cause Charlie to loose one of his keys.</desc>

		<desc>So you want to be a Knight of the King Abdul Honeickam Gargoy, young countryman? I can see that you are accurate with the arch, fast with the sword, and tough in hand-to-hand combat... but you need to prove that you're brave enough! My boy, you'll be locked in the Castle with no name. You've to survive the nightmare world inside... and escape alive! Others have tried without success, and were sadly transformed into ogres by the evil mage Nirlem. Good luck! This was one of the first games by Dinamic. It's a challenging side-scrolling game with Ghosts N' Goblins style gameplay, with some strange monsters (you know, the Castle was previously owned by Alucard!) and potions that can help you a bit. By the way... you can climb ropes, and will frequently need to.</desc>

		<desc>The planet Nonterraqueous is controlled by a master computer. You control a robot seeker drone trying to find and destroy this machine. You start with a laser and can get bombs but at swap stations you can change form. This new form cannot drop bombs or shoot lasers but it is not harmed by acid drops. You also have psyche stations that can reload you psyche but be careful. If you overload it you will be destroyed. You don't HAVE to change form for the acid drops. If you're quick and lucky enough, you can just avoid them. If you touch a proton thruster, an acid drop touches you in your acid vulnerable form, you overload you psyche, your psyche goes to zero or you're too low when you drop a bomb, you die.</desc>

		<name>NorthStar</name>
		<desc>The Northstar space station has been overrun by aliens, with all reports suggesting that the crew didn't survive. It's your job to progress through its floors, wipe out the aliens and restore order. What this entails is essentially a case of walking from left to right taking out everything you see. You are armed with a lance, which you can use from some distance, although you can only attack in one direction at a time, although aliens can come at you from all around, many of them using some wicked patterns. There are ledges to be climbed; the lance can be used to hoist your way up. Enemies often give off bubbles (for points) or stars (collect for an extra life). You are limited in the amount of oxygen you have to complete a level, and you have 4 lives, one of which is lost on contact.</desc>

		<path>./Nosferatu the Vampyre (Europe).zip</path>
		<name>Nosferatu the Vampyre</name>
		<desc>This game shares two major similarities to The Great Escape - firstly, it's licensed around a venerable film, using the setting to new effect. Secondly, it's isometrically-viewed (with monochrome graphics, even on the capable-of-far-better C64) and features full object interaction of the Filmation style - this is taken further here, as the physics of the objects are varied by their shape and centre of gravity. There are three stages to complete. In the first you play Johnathan Harker, who must retrieve some papers (he works for an Estate Agent's) and escape the castle. The second level introduces Johnathan's wife Lucy, and van Helsing, with play switching between the three. Lucy's role is slightly different as it is she who pursues the vampire itself, and she takes on the task alone in level 3. Food must be collected to keep the characters' strength up, and crucifixes and candles can be picked up to help matters.</desc>

		<desc>You find yourself in a world where the air has become unbreathable and Sun's light barely reaches planet Earth. With your planet almost desertic, many cities began to be built in other planets of the solar system. But... in Oberon, the fourth satellite, there appeared an strange life form, which did just awake from its lethargy. The worst of all is that these new creatures have started attacking the human populations, even if they are babies! Without wasting any more second, you decide to go to Oberon to save the few babies still alive, before they are eaten by these monsters. Once there, your mission would be to find the babies and send them to planet Earth in a safe way. For this, you will have to buy a cryogenic valve for each one of them in the ATMs of the Company, in order to provide them more safe travel. When you finish the mission, you will have to buy a ticket back to Earth. Oberon 69 is an arcade platformer where you will have to use your pistol to kill larvae, tentacles, robots, alien queens and her eggs, with the advantage that you can make frontal or vertical shots.</desc>

Four X1 boats armed with missiles tough it out over circuits set up in lakes and lined with rocks, desperately trying to avoid finishing last, as this will eliminate them from future competition.

For years it is inhabited by ghost Sir Humphrey and his pals Olli and Lisa but it is bought up by Eugine Portcullis III Jnr who wants to break it down and ship it to the States, bit by bit. Being rather attached to his castle, Sir Humphrey wants to scare Eugene away for good. Unfortunately, Sir Humphrey has lost his ability to make himself invisible. He can only regain his power by mixing special ingredients that Olli must find. In this flick-screen platform game you control Olli who must find each ingredient and return it one after another to Sir Humphrey within a set time limit. In each screen there are spooks, snakes and bats as well as dangerous gapes to avoid. Olli cannot really die, but when touched by a baddie he gets set back at the start of a screen costing valuable time. Collect all eight ingredients and Eugine Portcullis III Jnr. will be scared away for good.</desc>

Then the Ramboids must be herded towards the teleport receptor in a particular order. As well as the droid's standard movement mode, it can also tunnel or dig through the caverns. In later levels, the cavern designs become more complex and moving blocks create further problems.</desc>

		<name>Operation Thunderbolt</name>
		<desc>Operation Thunderbolt is the exciting sequel to Operation Wolf. An airliner is hijacked by terrorists en-route from Paris to Boston, who threaten to kill all hostages on board if their mates aren't released from jail. Instead of reaching its destination, the airliner makes a landing in Kalubya, Africa, and all the hostages are hidden in various locations. The authorities have asked the hero from Operation Wolf to rescue the hostages, but only this time, the hero brings his friend along for the ride. There are eight missions to complete in Operation Thunderbolt, and each one has you shooting down soldiers, choppers, and tanks. The gameplay varies every one or two missions. In some missions, you are driving a jeep or controlling a boat, while in others, you are walking while you're shooting. You have a limited supply of ammo, and a limited supply of rocket bombs, but you can always stock up by shooting down crates falling from the sky, or by killing a cat or dog that get in the line of fire. Also from crates, you can get special items like bulletproof vests, rocket bombs, and different weapons. You also have a life bar to worry about. If you're shot at by soldiers, or if rocket bombs or grenades are thrown at you, you 'll lose energy, and once you're energy is depleted, you lose one of your three lives. You can lose a lot of energy by killing hostages on purpose, and you can't easily avoid killing them if you decide to use rocket bombs to wipe out enemies. The eighth mission, the mission that involves you fighting terrorists on a plane, proves to be difficult because a woman in a blue dress stands up and gets in the line of fire, and you have to very careful when you're going to use rocket bombs. There are two endings to this game, and which ending you can watch will depend on the number of hostages you've saved, and whether or not you shot the pilot instead of the mission eight boss.</desc>

		<name>Operation Wolf</name>
		<desc>You have been recruited for Operation Wolf, a desperate attempt to rescue prisoners from the enemy. Through a series of missions, you'll engage a variety of enemies, from soldiers to ninjas, patrol boats to helicopters, and more. Can you carry the day? Operation Wolf is an arcade conversion of the game by Taito. It is essentially a bitmapped "rail-shooter", where you basically hold the gun and shoot just about everything that moves, while conserving your ammo and grenades. Shoot ammo/grenades and healing items on the screen to "pick them up". Your primary machine gun can kill everything if you hit it enough times, but you can also use the grenade launcher for really deadly targets like helicopters or armored cars. You can collect a machine gun which will allow you to shoot faster for a few seconds. You'll be pummelled by a LOT of enemies. Some will be shooting, others will be tossing grenades, knifes, and more. Some are armored and requires more than a few hits, others dodges. You can shoot grenades and knifes out of the air if you aim well enough. There are also civilians running around which can be shot, but it's not beneficial. Bosses appear at the end of some levels, and each has a specific weakness you need to exploit.</desc>

		<name>Oriental Games</name>
		<desc>The Oriental Games offer skilled martial artists the chance to prove themselves in Kung Fu, Kendo and the relatively brutal Kyo-Kus-Hin-Kai., using courage, skill and flare (sic) according to the packaging. It makes for a series of one-on-one fights viewed from the side. Kendo involves using a stick as your weapon, whereas Kung Fu various punches and kicks and Kyo-Kus-Hin-Kai involves head butts and flying attacks. You can jump over opponents; a quick tap of the fire button turns you around. You have an energy bar with 5 blocks of gradually decreasing colours, which drops when you are hit and increases as you pass time without being hit. Impressive moves earn you bonus Merit Awards. On the 16-bit versions, there are 3 skill levels (Novice, Professional and Master), digitised sound, and an editor to set up joystick moves. The 8-bit versions lack these niceties, but include an extra discipline, Sumo; these are played in sequence rather than by choice.</desc>

Kissed by a lovely woman and wearing the helmet, you should win the race accelerating and avoiding other competitors to do not crash into them or the debris in the water. In each waterway you must complete six laps, and at each end of the course, there are buoys which you must approach slowly in order to turn around. The other competitors are ill-mannered, regularly get in your way and want to throw you off the speedboat, so you often has to teach them a lesson of courtesy.</desc>

It all takes place in a post-apocalyptic universe in which a lot of money can be earned by transporting goods form place to place, but the large gangs of Overlanders who already do this are keen to stop you. Two missions are on offer at a time, one tougher but more lucrative than the other, with half the money paid upfront and the other half on successful completion. Before setting off, you can buy upgrades such as turbo chargers, armour and enhanced weapons, each of which has a limited lifespan. Attacks from other vehicles can come either from guns or attempting ramming, and the roads are poorly-maintained and hazardous, so be careful, or better yet be violent first.</desc>

		<desc>As a diver you explore the calm waters of the Pacific in a search of hidden treasures. Starting at the waves you dive deeper and deeper to the reefs, which form a labyrinth and block your way. During the diving you should move left/right, swim up or passively fall down on the screen until you reach its boundary, when you progress from one screen to another. Underwater inhabitants such as crabs or skates are harmful to your diving-suit so you have to shoot them with your pistol. You also have to push the dynamite to the seabed, find the doors, follow the passages, and collect the treasures. Encountering the depth sensors in the reefs you may check your position on the map. Your oxygen supply is exhausting during a diving so you have to top it up regularly. Game may be played in turns by 1 or 2 players of the same or different sex.</desc>

When he finally transports the fairy back to her home, Pac is given some magic shoes, which will help him get to his own home, where he will be greeted by his family: Ms. Pac-Man, Baby Pac-Man, Chomp Chomp, and Sourpuss. There are sixteen rounds to complete, with four trips each. During each round, he can grab a power pellet, which cause ghosts to turn blue, allowing Pac-Man to eat them for points. Points are also awarded by collecting fruit that appear, like cherries and strawberries. In some rounds, Pac must use a springboard to jump over a lake. He must also make it to the end of each round before time runs out, otherwise a ghost will chase him.</desc>

		<name>Pac-Mania</name>
		<desc>Pac-Mania is a variation on the game Pac-Man. You need to guide Pac-Man around a maze and eat all of the dots on the board in order to proceed on to the next round. Numerous, multi-colored ghosts also roam the maze trying to stop you. If you eat one of the power pellets in the maze, the ghosts will temporarily turn blue and run from you. Pac-man can earn bonus points by eating the ghosts when they are in this state. The maze is now in 3-D and is larger than screen which will scroll to follow the action. To help get out of tight spots, Pac-Man now has the ability to jump. But be careful, because some of the ghosts have learned this trick as well and you could end up in a mid air collision!</desc>

		<name>Pang</name>
		<desc>Pang is a platform game which consists of 50 levels in total. It can be played with one or two players on the same screen, and the other player can join anytime within the game. Your goal is to destroy the balloons which bounce around the playfield. To accomplish this, you can shoot hooks which travel upwards, and blow up any balloon they touch. Depending on their size, they either split on two smaller ones, or evaporate if they're at their minimum size. Apart from balloons, some levels also have barriers that have to be destroyed with your hooks, since they often block your access to balloons. There are also some barriers which cannot ever be destroyed. Your character has the ability to climb ladders, but cannot jump. You can also pick up power-ups such as: the ability to fire two shots at once, the hook that attaches to the ceiling and waits 'til something bumps into it, a gun which has a high rate of fire but cannot destroy barriers. Beside extra weapons, you can also pick certain things like clock (halting time for a small period), dynamite (reducing all balls to minimum size, thus making you able to reach more points), life, and such.</desc>

		<desc>As the pilot of an underpowered tank with stone wheels and a single-shot turret, you must take out the full force of tanks which inhabit the island of Panzadrome, which is split into 64 flick-screen regions. Nothing unusual there, but the tanks and mounted turrets of Panzadrome are robotic, and controlled by a central computer. Plasma vents send their power throughout the network, and are destructible but heavily protected by tanks  these are thus your main target. Upgrades to your tank can be purchased from robot factories, each of which offers a single product. The most important of these is the Polycrete, which allows you to repair the huge impassable craters that are left in the ground by enemy fire. This adds a puzzle element to the game, as you aim to kill tanks in wide areas where possible, to prevent boxing yourself in. Keep an eye on the scanner in order to avoid landmines, and dont allow your shields to be destroyed.</desc>

		<desc>Paris-Dakar is a rally simulator in which the player controls a wide variety of variables, including the state of the car (gasoline, water, damages, gear box...) and the race route (always accessible), among others. If needed, the player can refuel, buy water or whatever else is required from the powerboats in Europe or the tankers in Africa. Prices of these essential materials aren't always very reasonable, given the player's meagre starting wallet, motivating players to earn higher sponsorships through strong performance in the race. There are three different stages: one in Europe, another one in the desert of the Sahara, and finally a crossing of the Tenere desert before arriving in Dakar.</desc>

		<name>Park Patrol</name>
		<desc>Do you have what it takes to become a park ranger? This game will test you to see if you're really up to the job. You play a park ranger, whose job is to collect twelve items scattered around the park, such as soda cans, bottles, and balls. Unfortunately, getting these items is not as easy as it sounds, as your task gets difficult by swimmers, swamps, snakes, turtles, and ants. To make matters worse, your energy gets depleted quickly, so to restore it, you can either return to your hut, or snatch food off an ant's back in later levels. More often than not, some of the turtles will follow you into the lake. If they enter the lake, you can run them over for 500 points before they decide to jump back out again. Besides collecting items, you also must rescue swimmers that are about to drown in the lake. Fail to rescue a swimmer in a limited amount of time, and you'll also drown, and the same can be said if you bump into snakes. Rather than collecting items, you can also roll on logs. Doing this will earn you 5000 points if you manage to roll for a long time. There are five levels of Park Patrol to complete, and once you complete all of them, the diffculty level gets higher and the game becomes much more difficult. To give you an example, the turtles will stop at nothing to kill you, and there will be more than one swimmer to rescue at once. This game can have two players. Park Patrol even provides you with a menu, in which you can alter the number of turtles, ants, swamps, swimmers, and snakes in each of the five levels. With the menu, you can have none of these in every level, but what's the fun of completing a level without any enemies to avoid? Also, you can play as a boy or a girl.</desc>

		<desc>From Konami's coin-op, Ping Pong recreates the fast-paced sport of table tennis. To win each match you must get to 10 points with a 2 point lead - if the scores reach 10-9 the game goes on until someone has a 2 point lead or reaches 15, in a similar manner to tennis. There are nine skill levels to beat, with increasing abilities as the game goes on. The human player has the advantage of serving first, and as the serve reverses every five points, you are guaranteed to have more chances to serve than your opponent (remember the significance of 10 and 15 in the scoring). The points system rewards long rallies and large winning margins, as you get points for each hit, for each point won, and for each point of the winning margin.</desc>

		<name>Sid Meier's Pirates!</name>
		<desc>Take on the life of a buccaneer in the golden age of Caribbean Piracy! This game lets you choose from 6 different "ages" (for example, "The Silver Empire" from 1560-1600, "War For Profit" from 1640-1660, etc.), one of 4 nationalities (English, French, Dutch, Spanish), 4 difficulty levels, and one of 5 special abilities (skill at fencing, skill at navigation, etc.). Nine different types of ships were represented. The goal of the game is to retire with as much gold and land as possible, as many ranks/titles as possible (Colonel, Admiral, Marquis, Duke), and a wife. Finding long lost relatives helps too. You accomplish these goals by plundering cities, capturing and sinking enemy ships, getting in good with governors to receive titles, learn news of "evil Spaniards" holding your relatives, capturing evil pirates, etc. The game is educational, as you will learn about piracy through the thoroughly researched manual. You'll smell the sea salt as you participate in wild sword fights, desperate sea battles, and daring attacks by land!</desc>

		<path>./Platoon (Europe).zip</path>
		<name>Platoon</name>
		<desc>The film Platoon featured a squad of five soldiers on their mission for the US Army in Vietnam. In this action game based around the film, you take control of these five guys in turn, with the chance to switch between them as they each take one of the 3 hits that would kill them. The game recreates each of the sections of the film, starting with a side-scrolling journey through the jungle, with paths to cross both horizontally and vertically, and the ability to jump or duck hazards. You will need to blow up a bridge and then locate a village, which contains a torch, a map and a trap-door. The enemy has booby-trapped the area and are launching airstrikes, so the danger is not all from enemy ground soldiers. The next section is in first-person 3D, as you move through a network of tunnels in search of flares and a compass. There are 3 distinct control methods, changing from the standard motion when an enemy appears (this puts you in control of a cross-hair for more accurate targeting), and when you enter a room to search. After escaping this you settle in a bunker overnight, and have a limited amount of flares with which to locate incoming enemy, and must then shoot them before they can shoot you. The jungle airstrike from the film is the next moment - you have two minutes to rush into a safe position to the north, using your compass for guidance. Finally you face the treacherous Sergeant Barnes, and must hit him with grenades 5 times whilst trapped in a foxhole to prevent him wiping you out.</desc>

Bluto, UFO's, witches etc try to stop you. Some hearts are behind locked doors so you've got to find the right key to open the door and get them while others can be grabbed simply by jumping up to get them. Somewhere there's a fruit machine for which you need to collect 'spin' items. The game boasts a 'clever multidimensional effect' which allows Popeye to go behind the scenery and go through doors.</desc>

		<name>Popeye 2</name>
		<desc>Strange happenings are afoot once again in Sweethaven and only Popeye can make it right. In Popeye 2, our spinach lovin' hero must once again rescue Olive Oyl and make mincemeat of Bluto while looking after Swee'Pea, feeding Wimpy and keeping an eye on Jeep. Popeye has four different levels to traverse through. His initial adventure takes him to a construction site where bouncing springs, falling girders and open welding flames impede his progress. Rolling barrels, and bombs which must be touched to be put out also stand to cause harm. In every level scattered hamburgers must be collected in order for Popeye to get past Wimpy who is often hanging out somewhere near the top of every vertically scrolling platform level. There are also feats of strength that Popeye must perform by beating up a punching robot-type thing with the aid of Spinach. Once past all these obstacles Popeye can move on to the next level. The second level takes Popeye into the urban jungle where he must climb the side of the Biff Spinach building and avoid the same obstacles as in the previous levels. In the third level falling girders are replaced with giant bananas as Popeye finds himself in a jungle. Coconut throwing monkeys hang from ledges and snoozing tigers and snakes decorate the trees. The fourth and final level of the game finds Popeye climbing the masts of the S.S. Trev and the S.S. Andy as he makes his way to a final confrontation with Bluto and rescue Olive Oyl. Popeye is able to jump around and occasionally when the situation calls for it punch his way through this vertical platformer. Bonus points are rewarded for finding Swee'Pea and Jeep. He can take multiple hits before he takes a curtain call but thankfully is unharmed by long drops. The player should beware as Popeye has only one life to get through the four levels of this adventure.</desc>

There are 5 tracks to choose from, each with 5 stages. The stages range from cities, to deserts to tracks over water. There are also 12 drivers to pick from, from businessmen to skinheads and mohicans. Your buggy has 2 gears, high and low. Once the light goes green, just keep the pedal to the metal. Youll need to place third or higher to continue to the next stage. Be careful not to bump into other buggies or objects next to the road. While youre buggy can take a pounding, crashing will slow you down. Finish all 5 stages in a level and youll be presented with a bonus level.</desc>

		<name>Powerplay: The Game of the Gods</name>
		<desc>As one of the four great Gods Apollo, Hermes, Hecate and Aphrodite, choose a team of four mighty warriors to fight for you in the Powerplay tournament to prove who is the greatest. This battle will be fought out not using swords or knives, but with knowledge - gameplay takes the form of a complex quiz on a chess-like board. You have four playing pieces, which start off arranged as a cross in one corner of the isometrically-viewed board. The squares are split into four different colours, which each represent a particular broad Trivial Pursuit-style subject area. The question has four possible answers, and a correct answer allows you to move your piece one space, perhaps onto one of the four white teleport squares (which randomly places it on one of those four squares). When a piece lands on the same square as an opposition piece, a challenge ensues, which plays out like a quiz show, with questions asks in quick fire and the first player to answer gaining a point if right and losing one if wrong. The losing piece drops down a skill level. Once a piece reaches 25 Wisdom Points, it can mutate up a skill level - this makes it harder to beat, but makes the questions it faces harder.</desc>

		<desc>Prehistorik is a side-view platform game with superficial similarity to Chuck Rock, although the games were developed simultaneously in different countries. You control a neanderthal who must march through hostile pre-historic environments seeking food and keeping himself safe. Some food can be found in caves, but it mainly exists in living animal forms. These include fire-breathing Pyro-Tax dragons, the Turtosaurus, and the Bad Bat. Each of these must be clubbed to death, some taking up to 5 hits, and then walked over. Some other enemies are indestructible, with the monkeys who throw coconuts at you particularly fiendish. You will have to complete the level within the time limit, and avoid contact with these foes. However, bombs and improved weapons can be collected, as can extra lives, time bonuses and an improved jump.</desc>

An especially noteworthy aspect of the game is the very fluent animation of your character. The Game Boy Color and SNES versions of the game feature additional levels and new enemies. The Genesis version has a new intro and an altered set of graphics but the level layout remains almost identical to that of the original.</desc>

		<path>./Pro Power Boat Simulator (Europe).zip</path>
		<name>Pro Powerboat Simulator</name>
		<desc>If this 'simulator' is to be believed, powerboat racing is a chaotic race across a number of largely one-directional tracks with fjords and inlets forcing you down one of two lanes, and sections where a bridge needs to be cleared by hitting a ramp at the right speed beforehand (as you jump over these, you can land so as to skim off other boats). Your boat is fitted with bombs, which can be placed so as to force the other boats to run over them, gaining you points. Extra bombs and fuel litter the course, often close to the banks, which you must avoid contact with, for fear of crashing your boat. When this happens you are forced into the next one, which is, as if by magic, available at a convenient point just beforehand. A helicopter flies overhead, dropping bombs which you must avoid, and often obscuring your view. The other boats often crowd together attempting to force you into the wall. As with all the Codemasters budget titles, realism goes out of the window, with an emphasis on simple instantaneous action.</desc>

		<desc>Codemasters applied the fast-pitching 3D isometric graphics of Marble Madness to this recreation of skateboarding. There are 7 levels of gameplay, each featuring a skate park and then a cross-country section with a top-down view. In the skate park you have to collect all the flags, without leaving the tarmac too much, and within a strict time limit. In the cross-country event you must skate between a series of flags. This time there are hazards such as trees and buildings to avoid hitting.</desc>

		<desc>Prohibition is a shoot'em up taking place in New York in 1930. The town is overrun by gangsters and you're hired by the police to rid the town of them. The gameplay is simple: you're facing a row of buildings, a gangster pops up and you have to shoot him before the on-screen timer goes empty and he shoots you first. You can hide until the timer restarts but this is limited too. At the end of each stage is a bonus round where you have to shoot gangsters in a room, with no more ability to hide and a faster timer. As you progress through each stage, the game will become faster, and enemies will become harder to find and to hit. Of course, your goal is to reach the end of the game with the highest possible score.</desc>

This means walking through 256 screens of minions, and getting each part of the protection code. The droids emerge from particular points of the level, and constantly regenerate, so your path must be precisely navigated. You can collect a suit of armour for protection, improved weaponry (the initial unit only fires horizontally), and a high-speed scooter - each of which last for the next 3 screens. Extra lives can be collected en route.</desc>

		<name>Psyborg</name>
		<desc>You are a psyborg named Duncan Norton, who must travel through the vortex from a space vessel trapped in a galaxy very far from Earth. An alien race is threatening to take over 38 planets and you've got to stop them. Starting from Anacreon, you will mentally pass through the Krypton, Kalgan, Zorgon, Terminus, Trantor, and finally Sol systems. Each stellar system has a certain number of planets, which you will traverse from one to another. The game is a first-person virtual reality race, where you run as fast as possible on the tiles that are formed in a pentagonal prism. At the starting point you accelerate, and then change the facets of the prism in order to avoid falling through the gaps. When the tile's path spirals, you may decelerate your velocity. Time runs out, and you must refill your time meter by standing on tiles marked with a "T". Standing on certain tiles that are marked with shapes of different blinking colors will give you a different amount of points. Special actions, such as jumping from one part of prism to another as well as teleporting forward and back, may be performed. Save points are placed on the track but the number of prism facets may change during your run. Finishing the race to each planet will give you a password, which may be used later to start from this point. The best scores will be written in High Scores table. The game is available for 1 or 2 players.</desc>

		<desc>Sequel to Athena, the 2d side-scroller which starred a "kawaii" version of the greek goddess Athena as she set out to find adventure in the mortal world. Changing her bikini for a Japanese schoolgirl uniform, Athena uses her new psychic powers (hence "psycho" soldier... erm... yep, anyway...) to clear a post-apocalyptic world of its mutant inhabitants with the help of her friend Kensu (thus allowing simultaneous 2 player gameplay). Gameplay consists of the usual run 'n jump fare typical of the genre with the added feature of a constantly scrolling background, which added to the many "option"-style power-ups and Athena's own psychic blasts make the game a strange shooter/platformer hybrid.</desc>

Each stage is filled with the typical hazards of a traditional play, like crocodiles, custard pies and rotten tomatoes, as well as the pits that must be crossed via moving platforms. You'll sometimes have the chance to catch a sausage flying around in the air as you move along. Even though it is a rather early game, the Spectrum version features some interesting speech samples using a technique that was very uncommon at that time.</desc>

		<name>Puzznic</name>
		<desc>The challenge in each level of Puzznic is to maneuvre a selection of blocks into place so as to clear them all, by making them make contact with blocks of the same design. You control a cross-hair, which can move a block left or right, which can cause it to fall if there is no block under the space it would occupy. There are many complications in terms of solving the levels. Moving platforms meaning that you need to move a block at a particular time, or in particular order, to prevent them being blockaded. In some situations there are an odd number of a certain type of block - solving these requires positioning two of the blocks one space apart, such that a move will result in a piece making contact with 2 others, and immediately removing all 3. You will also encounter blocks positioned on platforms suspended in space and gaps in level arrangements meaning that a certain number of blocks must be in place to make a certain move possible (by forming a stack, for example) The game structure is slightly unusual, as after you complete each batch of four levels you get a choice of 2 sets of levels - you are progressing through an expanding matrix of levels, which means there are 2 sets on level 2, 3 on level 3, 4 on level 4, and so on. This means that there are a total of 220 screens in the game. Each screen is played against a time limit, and losing a level (either by running out of time, or by making a poor move and leaving an impossible position) loses one of your 3 lives.</desc>

		<desc>Wally Week has become trapped inside one of his own nightmares, and is in danger of failing to wake up from it in time for work. Only you can save him from the inevitable sack, by finding the key that can be used to bring your alarm clock to life. The world inside his head is large and varied, with escalators, lifts and locked doors used to navigate it. Only two objects can be carried at a time, but some must be used in tandem, and others only become active when you walk over them while carrying one or two items they require to become active. As this is a nightmare world, not everything is as it seems - everything is enlarged, and axes, punching hands and ghosts are all out to get you. Your energy is measured by a 'Snooze Energy' meter depicted by a glass of milk - once this drops to minimum, one of your 3 lives is lost.</desc>

		<desc>Mounting your Quad, you, Agent X27, have only idea in mind: to cross the border and leave the desert with the plans you are carrying as quick as possible. Half of secret services are already chasing you and they will not be gentle! In addition, the representatives of Agency "forgot" to inform you that the track across the desert was not used for years. There was everything: rocks, boulders, cacti and even the carcasses of animals! With all this, you should not miss jerrycans placed by Agency to refuel your Quad. And also avoid the helicopter! The game is a third-person racing arcade set in the desert full of different obstacles. The player controls the Quad to stay on the track, avoiding the obstacles, and collecting the jerrycans to refuel the Quad. If the fuel level reaches zero, helicopter appear and eliminate the Quad's life. Time is flowing and you should speed up your Quad. Points are earned as the player progresses through the game. The player begins with a limited number of lives; lives may be decreased with Quad's elimination, and increased with certain amount of points gained. The game is available for 1-6 players performing their actions one-by-one to compare their results after the game finish.</desc>

		<name>Quadrel</name>
		<desc>Quadrel is a puzzle game in which you must fill each piece of the selected layout with different colored paints, without painting two adjacent pieces the same color. At the beginning of a game, you can select the desired image or layout, as well as whether you wish to play with unlimited time or not. You can also select the "Imposed" game mode, in which the game points which piece you must fill next. Each layout has a set amount of paint available for use, in four different colors: red, green, blue and yellow. The amount of brush stokes left for each color is indicated on your palette. Some layouts have a large amount of a particular color and a very small amount of another, while other layouts have a more even amount of each color. The goal is to plan well from the start, so as to avoid running out of a particular color that will be needed to finish the layout. The game can be played in solitaire mode, against the computer, or against another human player on the same screen. There are no sound effects during gameplay, only music. If you manage to finish a layout, you can enter your name in a high score table.</desc>

Get the jet-pack to make it easier to navigate the level and shoot any inhabitants that get in the way. These inhabitants will leave behind something that you can get to increase your score, and the inhabitants will eventually regenerate. If any one of them touches you while you have the jet-pack, you land on the ground or the nearest platform, and have to get it again; and the same rule applies to the key.</desc>

		<desc>Rather than creating a pure arcade game, Five Ways aimed at creating a true simulation of rallying that also had educational value. As such, a full map of the area is provided, a degree of route-planning is required, with each road having its own properties. Some have a higher possible speed, some are more likely to flood when it rains, and some are prone to being closed. You can get information on current conditions (and avoid a 50-second penalty) by stopping at a checkpoint. The hazards featured in the game are unusual - spectators running onto the track and stray farm animals must be avoided, and a definite penalty is imposed for driving the wrong way down a road. The race is in three stages, and drivers are eliminated after each of the first 2.</desc>

		<desc>Rambo's mission is set deep in Afghanistan, in the days when the Soviets occupied it, and America was putting this right (we won't mention who they enlisted to do so). Colonel Trautman has been kidnapped by the Soviets, and you've gone in there to rescuing him. Doing so is a three-part operation approximately following the plot of the film. In the first part, you explore the building Trautman could be in, through a top-down view of the building. It is heavily protected by infra-red security beams, which when activated unleadsh the enemies. The locations of the beams are only apparent if you collect the special goggles. Other hazards include mines, trapdoors and booby-trapped doors, but there are enhanced weapons to collect. Section two is identical to the first, except that it is located outside, the enemy are onto you from the start, and there are no traps. The final section changes to an Operation Wolf-style shoot 'em up, with a horde of tanks, foot soldiers and helicopters to face. Your gun can jam, which adds to the challenge of finally getting out alive.</desc>

		<desc>George, Lizzy and Ralph were just ordinary Americans, until an experiment went wrong, turning them into a Gorilla, Lizard and Werewolf respectively. Following this, the three of them plan to go round destroying buildings, and up to 3 human players can join in. Smashing at the edges of the buildings for long enough will make them collapse. The police and military are after you, and will shoot at you, so try to destroy them (failing that, you can avoid the bullets). You will need to eat regularly, with things like plants on offer, to avoid shrinking back to being human</desc>

		<name>Ramparts</name>
		<desc>Not to be confused with Atari Games' Rampart, Ramparts is in fact a clone of Bally Midways' Rampage, but with a medieval theme, and players are giant knights instead of monsters. The game is for one or two players simultaneously, and each has the opportunity to enter in a five-character name before play begins, which will subsequently be displayed next to individual scores during play. The game takes place on a single screen, where the player(s) can move left and right on one foreground plane, and the object is to destroy a castle, each phase, by scaling and punching the individual buildings until each, and all collapses. Buildings will often overlap, requiring some to be taken down before others. Players will be harassed by witches, goblins, archers and the like. The back story concerns two knights, Sir Griswold and Sir Larkin, who have had a curse set upon them to be transformed into giants by the Evil One, and they must quest for the fiend, so that they may be restored to mere mortals.</desc>

		<name>Rana Rama</name>
		<desc>The purpose of apprentice courses is for young people to learn a trade gradually, without putting yourself or your employers at risk. Unfortunately, nobody explained this to Wizards apprentice Mervyn, before he tried to cast a spell to make him irresistible to females, as the spell misfired, and made him attractive only to female frogs. However, his dungeon was soon invaded, and Mervyn was not killed, as he appeared to be a humble frog. Viewed from above, the aim is to kill all 96 of the wizards who have invaded the dungeon, which is split into 8 levels, each made up of 16 screens and at least 50 rooms. To see whats in a room he has to enter it, in a manner similar to the Switchblade games. The games rather esoteric title comes from the way you obtain spells to upgrade the four different types of power you have (power, offence, defence and effect). When you meet a warlock you enter a mini game in which the letters RANARAMA are in random order, and by swapping pairs of letters in sequence you must form the full word in as little time as possible. This system of having a sub-game for collecting upgrades is similar to the grappling concept in Paradroid. This earns up to four of the Runes (Mysticism, Witchcraft, Magecraft and Runecraft), each of which can be used on one of the four types of power. The Magecraft offensive use is a fireball, defence for Runecraft makes you invisible to enemies, and the special effect for Witchcraft allows you to jump through space. Lose a life and you lose all these powers, and losing another life means its Game Over.</desc>

The first job is to get the droid repaired, after which you must regain control of the power generator and the engines. The game is controlled by moving MSB directly, with a teleport facility on the droid allowing you to move one object at a time. Spanner-type devices are mounted from the floor - guiding MSB into the top of these reveals puzzles which can be used to unlock doors to reach other sections of the ship. Before any power can be generated and the ship's scanner accessed, a leak must be fixed by finding and using a piece of spare piping.</desc>

		<path>./Rebel Planet (Europe).zip</path>
		<name>Rebel Planet</name>
		<desc>You play the part of an agent of SAROS, the Terran resistance movement against their imperial alien overlords, the Arcadians. Disguised as a merchant, you will fly your ship, the Caydia, to three different colony planets -- Tropos, Halmuris, and Arcadion -- to rendezvous with underground freedom fighters and gather the intelligence you require to destroy the central computer of the Arcadian hivemind, liberating humanity! An adaptation of Robin Waterfield's Fighting Fantasy gamebook #18, published the previous year, this computer game version rejects the Choose-Your-Own-Adventure gameplay design of the book in favour of a more open-ended text adventure model, albeit one with a restrictive text parser. Most elements of the trademark Fighting Fantasy RPG system, including the randomness of even simulated die-rolls, have been streamlined out, leaving only metrics for damage taken and hunger (hitherto untracked in the books.) Carrying limits, while atypical in FF gamebooks, are enforced here as in the original book. A further new dynamic includes the strict timetable of the space traffic control towers -- you need to have wrapped up your business planetside before your launch window comes up, otherwise you're out of luck. In keeping with the game's sci-fi setting (in both rural and urban flavours), you will find extensive use of objects such as your limcom, nutritious hcaps (tasty like dead Zorkons, num num!), and the indispensable lite-kube. Combat has been largely phased out in favour of an extension of the gamebook's espionage theme of ciphers and passwords, magic words with the power of plot advancement. A version of this game also came out for the BBC Micro.</desc>

Moonbase Delta may look like an unassuming mining colony, but in fact, it is the secret location of the ISAAC super-computer, used by the Empire to break the Rebels' secret codes. The Rebelstar Raiders' mission is to break in, get past the patrolling robot guards and destroy the computer. It won't be easy. Your Raiders each have a specific number of action points per move, which can be allocated to movement, firing and object manipulation. Keys, medical kits and repair droids are among the available objects. Shots can be precise, point-blank (less points used, but less prospect of success), wide-range, or opportunist.</desc>

As you travel the city you must pay attention to your popularity ratings - you can play the game either to perform good or evil. The game uses a text parser with a vocabulary allowing for actions such as walking, looking around, arresting people, hitting them, using objects, or waiting in a set position for a set amount of time - every action sees time get used up. Standard input methods such as using AND or commas to delimit multiple commands, and leaving out words like THE and SOME are implemented. Being in Redhawk mode uses up energy, so this must be used sparingly.The screen display is in comic book style, with the last 3 drawings on screen at each time.</desc>

		<desc>Renegade 3 was the third and last in the Imagine's series, based on the original coin-op by Taito. The hero's girlfriend has been beamed into the future, while the man himself has been sent back into prehistory. This sets the scene for a sideways scrolling arena combat game, where the player fights in various time periods. The settings varied from Egyptian and medieval, to a futuristic level. As such, gone are the attacks of street gangs from the first two iterations of the series, replaced by assailants such as knights in armor and robots. In each level you have six minutes to reach the finish, as this is all the time the time-travel portal is available for. There are many surface hazards to avoid, as well as multi-layered Green Beret-style areas. You can kick and punch at different heights, allowing you to deal with each of the diverse foes.</desc>

		<path>./Rescue From Atlantis (Europe).zip</path>
		<name>Atlantis</name>
		<desc>The advanced civilization of the planet Somerset built a gigantic exploratory spaceship called Atlantis, and sent it to research the planet Earth. After the completion of its task, the ship submerged to an oceanic abyss. The D.A.G. ("giant-looking depredators"), a war-mongering civilization, took possession of Atlantis with the intention of conquering Somerset and the universe. Somerset sends a hero to rescue Atlantis from the enemy, and return it home. Rescue from Atlantis is a Spanish side-scrolling action-adventure game divided in three loads: 1. In the first load, the hero must find a way to gain entrance to the camouflage city built on top of Atlantis. This level starts with the bathysphere being dropped from the sky into the ocean by a spaceship. Once it hits the bottom, the player can guide it by using O and P to move left and right, respectively. Q makes it go up, and A cycles through its inventory. The bathysphere is armed with a laser gun that can be fired by pressing the SPACE bar. Hitting M ejects the protagonist from the bathysphere as to explore more strait entrances. Once out, M also serves as the GET, DROP, ENTER and USE button. There are objects scattered on the sea floor to be collected and used. The bathysphere also comes with some useful paraphernalia: ? A laser pistol to kill the enemy and the sea life; ? A jetpack to reach higher places; ? A portable computer to connect with the main one in Atlantis; ? A mould to fabricate gold bars. There are some gold nuggets on the submersed caves (to melt them the player has to find a source of heat); ? A first-aid kit that can only be used once. The player investigates a complex of aquatic tunnels while collecting the needed tools for the task ahead. At the top of the screen there are two horizontal bars. The leftmost indicates the oxygen level (there are places on the levels that replenish it). The one in the right side is the bathysphere fuel level, once empty the vessel will stop moving. The player must find sources of fuel to make it swim again. Amongst the two bars sits the inventory of both the bathysphere and the character. At the bottom of the screen there are two scores and a plant between them. The plant is the energy level of the character, it changes with every hit he/she/it receives. The left score is the current score, the one on the right is the top score. In this first load, the main danger comes from the creatures of the sea: octopuses, sharks and abyssal fishes take a bit of the energy when the character touches them. In the second load the bathysphere enters the city that was raised on Atlantis, now under the sea and in ruins. Guarding the entrance to the ship is Korx, a powerful D.A.G. mage. The main objective of this level is to find a way to destroy him (he is invulnerable to the laser weapons). Besides the animals of the previous load, the character has to fight hammerheads and some alien creatures. The final load sees the bathysphere entering Atlantis. The ship is a mechanical labyrinth, with lifts and sentinel robots. The main objective is to find the computer room, where the hero can activate the ship and bring it back to Somerset. The game has a password system: after solving each load, an alphanumeric code is displayed on the screen. The code is generated based on the actions accomplished. The second and third load require this code to start. It is possible to reach an unwinnable situation by failing to collect or assemble the necessary objects for the completion of a later level.</desc>

		<name>Rescue on Fractalus!</name>
		<desc>Rescue on Fractalus is an action game played from a 3D first person point of view. Your mission is to rescue stranded pilots on the planet of Fractalus. You begin each mission from the mother ship, and when your quota of pilots has been rescued you must return there so you can move on to the next level. To help locate the pilots and navigate the tricky terrain, your spaceship is equipped with various instruments, such as a compass, altimeter, and scanner. Your enemy, the Jaggi's, have numerous forces on this planet and will be attempting to stop you. Gun emplacements, flying saucers, and the Jaggi themselves are all capable of destroying your ship if you don't destroy them first. To defend yourself from these threats, your ship is equipped with torpedoes. As the levels progress, the Jaggi defenses become more aggressive, and you will even need to fly some night missions where visibility is limited!</desc>

		<desc>The command robots of Snowball have found the colonisable planet Eden, and already set about colonising this lush verdant planet. Not easy though - native plants and animals have adapted and fought back at the threat to their territory. A walled area now encloses the city, which is crumbling around you. When Snowball 9 reaches the planet, Commander Kim Kimberley is filmed apparently committing a murder. As Kim, you must escape from the 'justice' of crazed robot droids. Snowball 9's landing is made dangerous due to the robots malfunctioning. Return to Eden is an interactive fiction game which sets you as Kim, and challenges you to enter and survive within the robot city. Strange and surreal outcomes about - what do you get when you plant a brick? The world includes a bank, a theme park, the Corridors of Power, and a Starbike. Unlike its predecessor, it features graphics, with over 200 illustrative pictures featured. adds the ability to type while the screen is updating. Vocabulary is simplified - a new IT command refers to the last-mentioned object, and clothing can be WEAR'ed without being GET'ted first.</desc>

		<name>Return to Oz</name>
		<desc>Based on the overlooked but dark in tone 1985 Walt Disney movie Return To Oz which was a non-musical sequel to The Wizard Of Oz, this combined story elements from L. Frank Baum's novels Ozma Of Oz and The Marvelous Land Of Oz. The game plot follows the movie pretty closely. After returning to Kansas, no one believes Dorothy's story. When she can't sleep, Auntie Em seeks help from a doctor who wants to give her scary tests in an insane asylum. Dorothy escapes and finds herself back in the Land of Oz where she learns the Nome King has taken over and has destroyed the Emerald City and the Yellow Brick Road. Your new companion is Billina the chicken who in Oz can talk. You will meet a scarecrow named Jack Pumpkinhead, and a robot named Tik-Tok, among others. Dorothy must stop the Nome King and the witch Mombi who wants Dorothy's head for her collection, and restore Princess Ozma to the throne. There is a command line at bottom of screen with the following options: Look, Talk, Search, Get, List, and Leave. List shows you all the items you are carrying and shows you a sub-menu to Drop or Use an item. The top of the screen offers a text description of the graphics scene shown. As the game is intended for kids, when you select a command that is allowed on a particular screen, the person or objects on screen will flash to show what can be done and where. Hitting the space bar moves the cursor to the next available option available.</desc>

The Atari 2600 version is one or two player, alternating. The Atari 2600 version also has another difference in that you don't HAVE to eat the birdseed but you can for the points.

Combining different functions of robots you as a distant manager have to explore the underground tunnels of the planet, to avoid falling destroying items, shoot the creatures, which take your energy out, and to find the important resource. Every robot can fly to bypass the planet's gravitation, but the surface of the planet is looks like a mixed fractal. No surface, but many obstacles formed a labyrinth with big gaps to move in. Some creatures want to taste robots, it leads to loss of robot's energy, so you have to shoot them in horizontal plane. Also unique features of robots allow you as pilot-manager to use robots as a team. XOR collects the resources, SAM repairs other robots but not itself if they break-down, and RHO transmits communications from the other two robots back to you.</desc>

They took what was left of Murphy, encased it in titanium armor, wiped his memory and created RoboCop. Now it's up to RoboCop to clean the streets of Detroit and eliminate the one responsible for his murder, Clarence Boddicker. But it looks like Clarence might not be the kingpin of this town... Based on the 1987 movie of the same name, RoboCop allows the player to control RoboCop. The majority of the game is a side scroller. RoboCop can punch unarmed citizens and shoot armed citizens. He can move left, right and duck but can not jump. Different weapons can be picked up from enemies, and power-ups to restore health and/or energy. Following levels, RoboCop will have to match a criminal's face to the proper mugshot and engage in a first-person shooting bonus round.</desc>

		<desc>RoboCop 2 is a mission-based platform game. Missions have various objectives, such as destroying nukes or killing all the enemies. If you didn't destroy/kill enough, you'll be transported to a training mission, which is a first-person perspective shoot 'em up. Should you also fail the training, you must go to the beginning of the previous mission. Successfully completed mission or enough points scored by training allow you to proceed to the next stage. Unlike in the first RoboCop, there's no time limit, and you are able to jump.</desc>

Cimbel Lin, Ted Matare, Jansen Sino and Fighter Bull must be dealt with in order, with fights getting tougher as you progress.The action is viewed in 3D, from behind your boxer and with a full view of your opponent. A health bar is provided for each player, going from green to red as hits are scored. When the strength goes down to zero, a punch will floor your opponent - either player can be seen hitting the floor when a knockout blow is struck. Three knockouts are required to win a fight.</desc>

		<desc>Rock 'n Roll is a real-time puzzle game. You know, there's this ball, and it's stuck in a labyrinth for no apparent reason. Never mind -- let's just help him out, okay? You control the friendly, spotted ball with the cursor keys. It'll gain speed as it goes, bounce off when it hits obstacles, loose energy when it's caught in traps, die when it falls off the platform. The 32 levels through which you've got to guide the ball are full of traps: laser barriers, ramps, tubes, breakable tiles etc. Colored keys will open doors, switches create (or destroy!) helpful items. These include picks to repair floor tiles, parachutes to prevent you from falling off and bombs to destroy walls. Items have to be bought with coins that are found all over the level. The inertia of the ball has a very realistic feel to it, making the control intuitive and relatively easy. Not so easy, however, is the design of the (huge) levels; to finish Rock 'n Roll, you need skill as well as patience. You got the balls?</desc>

		<name>Rock Star Ate my Hamster</name>
		<desc>You are Cecil Pitt, a wannabe rock star manager. You must choose from 1-4 rock stars (with names such as Tina Turnoff and Wacko Jacko) to manage by viewing their audition tapes. Once you chosen your artists you then have to choose what kind of gear to get them - spanking new, second hand or dodgy. The dodgy gear is dirt cheap but you might pay for your choice later on in the game. To make your group a star, you have options such as practicing, publicity stunts, and buying gifts for your stars. Each action you choose advances the calendar by one day and you have until December to achieve your ultimate aim of superstardom - represented by a line graph which rises or falls depending on the performance of your band's releases. Once your band has recorded their first album you can choose to release the single and/or the album. The single needs a video to go with it which costs varying amounts of cash depending on which director you choose. You can choose to go for publicity, but this can be risky as there is a chance that one of your rock stars will be in the papers as an ex-rock star who died in any of many strange ways (all that's missing is a 'bizarre gardening accident'). Publicity affects your sales directly and also affects the crowds who attend your gigs. You lose the game if either you run out of money, or all of your rock stars die.</desc>

		<name>Rodland</name>
		<desc>Taking a rather literal view of the term 'slap-stick humour', Rodland features two fairies called Tam and Rit, whose mission is to rescue their mum who's been captured and taken to a castle. There are 40 screens to clear, all full of baddies, who are disposed of by grabbing them with a stick, and flipping them from side to side to inflict damage. The hits needn't all be inflicted at the same time, as it's possible to release them to move them out of the way. When killed, each bad guy releases some kind of extra, ranging from points bonuses to various devices which can be used to kill other enemies. Each level also contains a certain amount of fruit. If you can collect all of this (with some bad guys still alive - you move on immediately once they're gone) you enter a bonus game, in which each enemy's death results in one of the letters E,X,T,R and A being released - collect them all for an invaluable extra life. In the Game Boy version the difficulty lies slightly lower because the player can use his wand even when climbing ladders.</desc>

The twenty levels each feature 9 screens worth of squares, with no scrolling across them as such. On each level you are set a target number of crosses of each colour to collect, with less and less leeway as to how many of the different ones are required as the game goes on. There are pre-programmed moving enemies on each level to plan around, but the level's blocks vary in many ways. There are holes on the levels, but these can be jumped by pressing fire. You can turn plain squares into either crosses or holes, both of which invert the status of the crosses and holes respectively as well. Mystery squares (whose effect can be good or bad) and clock squares (which stop the timing and slow the aliens) are also present.</desc>

In essence it's a 3D Pong game, with the aim being to hit a ball towards the other player in such a way that he will be unable to return it. When the ball hits the back wall their opponent scores 5 points, with the first player to reach 35 being declared the winner. The screen is split into two, showing the view of each player, with the bat in the middle to start with. The game speed can be altered from adagio (slow) to vivace (fast), and the skill of the computer player can be altered, as can the screen colour. A 2-player option is included</desc>

		<name>R-Type</name>
		<desc>R-Type is a side scrolling shoot 'em up best known for its extremely tough and strategic gameplay. You control the R-9 spaceship as it launches a last-ditch effort to repel the evil Bydo empire. The R-9 comes equipped as standard with a small gun which can only take down the smallest of enemies without firing several shots. By holding down the fire button, it can be loaded up so as to release a large burst of energy, eliminating all but the strongest enemies in its path. From time to time, pods will come flying in your direction. Upon being shot, they release an upgrade. The first one will invariably be the one called "The Force", which is a weapons pod that clings either to the front or the back of your ship, absorbing any enemy bullets or acting as a bumper with which you can fly head-on into them. You can also use it as an offensive weapon by firing it and pulling it back in. Mastering the Force is vital to surviving in R-Type, since it must be used both as protection against bullet clusters, as a remote controlled cannon, and in order to clear the screen from obstacles. Other upgrades give you target-seeking missiles or a bigger main gun. Different gun types, differentiated by their colour, serve different purposes. The blue one sends laser beams bouncing across the screen (good for tunnels), the red one fires straight ahead, and the yellow one follows any walls it may encounter (good for artillery emplacements). The stages of R-Type are made in an organic style, certainly inspired by H. R. Giger's artwork for the Alien movies. When it came out, it was considered trend-setting since it broke off from the stereotypical sci-fi mould of other shoot'em'ups. In part, the levels themselves are your enemy, which is exemplified by the fourth, where spider-like creatures weave webs that cover the screen and block your path, or levels with intricate tunnel systems. Still, the levels are best handled with a combination of strategy and reflexes, without the memorisation that is required of R-Type's contemporary rival, Gradius.</desc>

		<desc>Due to an accident involving Professor Flipnoodles' Pocket Rocket (would you trust a scientist called Flipnoodles? I certainly wouldn't, especially as mad scientists cause so many computer game plot disasters) the Hanna Barbera characters have been hurtled into space. The Lilli-Punies have kidnapped them, and will only let them free if they can rescue their missing compatriots. The search starts on the surface of the planet, but also takes Ruff underground into the cavernous regions the Lilli-Punies live in. These have lots of water, which Ruff must avoid. Plenty of extra lives can be collected along the way, with solving puzzles as important as good reactions and dexterity.</desc>

		<desc>Runestone takes the panoramic views and multiple characters of Lords of Midnight and allies them to adventure-style features. There are NPCs who have specific roles in the storyline, move in real-time, and can be given instructions. You have the ability to directly enter buildings, and a changing score is constantly kept. The land of Belorm consists of Warriors, Wizards and Elves. The Great Wizards ensured centuries of peace, before legions of orcs attacked from the Northern Wastes. A series of sneak attacks weakened Belorm, the last of them killing Elwin. However, the Great Book leads Greymarel the Wizard to believe that Kordomir is the mythical Dark One, and the greatest threat. Now Belorm and can only be saved if Greymarel, Eliador (the last of the Elves), and Morval the Warrior can find the Runestone, a sacred device sculpted by Zaphir the Great Wizard. Commands are input from the keyboard. You can move in a direction by typing (for example) GO or MOVE E, or alternatively can LOOK E and then GO  only N/S/E/W movement is offered, so moving northeast requires 2 moves. Instructions for other characters are issued using TELL or ASK. When issuing combat instructions, you can specify the target orc and the weapon to be used. Chain commands are accepted Greymarel has little spell-casting ability as the game starts, but can gain many as they are discovered. He also has many strange relics, which may prove to be of use. Key NPCs include Chronos the Wise, Quester the Hermit and Brunor the Bold. The Great Waters separate the north from the south; they must be crossed via boats.</desc>

Thus, the game is a clear spoof of the very popular TV series, M*A*S*H*. It is an adventure using text inputs with occasional graphics. Your job is to get a still back, but you have no idea where it is nor how to get it - the supplied instructions offer little more than a command list. Usually, you will get a description of the room, as well as a listing of items, vehicles, and possible exits. To go in another direction, all you need to do is just enter the first letter of the direction that you want to go (eg: N for north).</desc>

You are capable of all manner of ninja-style moves including kicks and punches, as well as using weaponry. You must travel through an underground complex linked mainly by platforms and ladders, before triggering a bomb and escaping the complex. Your energy recharges if you stay still, so finding areas free of guards (kill these for money) and dogs (avoid them; killing them gains you nothing) is useful, especially as you only have one life. There's plenty of object manipulation involved, although only one item can ever be carried at a time.</desc>

The game takes place on a thoroughly huge map, and the viewed area often includes section which overlap and can't be reached directly, due to the huge shrubs and trees which are used as borders. The gameplay has many similarities to Ultimate's earlier Atic Atac title (even though they charged almost twice as much for it). It combines shooting (creatures such as spiders and hippos are among the many ferocious delights on show), and puzzle solving, largely involving manoeuvring objects. Once you run out of lives, the game tells you the percentage completed; chances are you'll be surprised that hours of exploration only cover half of it.</desc>

		<desc>When a person reaches elevated levels of popularity, the eager eyes of some programmers nail in him, and with these lucid minds they begin to emanate ideas that end up materializing into a program, or at least a commercial. This is the case with this Italian youngster singer of overwhelming personality that enters by the hand of Iber Soft to the world of videogames. The game develops the eventful journeys that a popular singer -Sabrina- must suffer to be able to be transferred from the airport to the nearest television studios. In order to arrive there, she must cross a town whose inhabitants seem to be a little dis-conformed with their way to be, to act and, mainly, to dress. Your mission will be to guide Sabrina in this arduous way, avoiding or eliminating as more as possible enemies. They are of several kinds, although all of them have an aspect in common: they are normal and current people of whom you can be found in the street to dozens. Thus, for example, the typical housewives, the knifer, the aggressive punkie, the exorcist priest, the old woman with her indispensable cane and a long list of others of citizen tipisms.</desc>

		<name>Saint and Greavsie</name>
		<desc>Saint and Greavsie is a sports trivia game where one to four players have to answer sport-related questions. Players start by throwing a ball across a series of stadiums. To the left of these stadiums is a green bar, and the higher the green bar, the greater the distance the ball will go. Depending on where the ball lands, the player has to answer three types of questions from one of four question packs. Home questions (worth one point) are generally related to modern football and are the easiest to answer. Away questions (worth two points) are generally related to football in the 1960s and '70s with teasers about 'golden oldies'. Finally, derby questions (worth three points) will test your knowledge of football trivia, and these questions are fun as well as factual. Players can choose to answer the question or pass onto the next player. If the player chooses to answer a question correctly, a penalty shootout is given which involves the player kicking a goal to score bonus points. The winner of the game is declared after all players have completed 21 or 42 matches (when one league season is completed). The winner is the player who has the most points.</desc>

		<desc>Cyborg Monsters have taken over the galaxy, reducing race after race into slavery. Being designed by man these beings have superior firepower and attack capabilities, and can only really be beaten by one of their own. St. Dragon the Cyborg Warrior chooses to fight back against this tyranny, and that is the role you take in this horizontally scrolling shoot 'em up. Five R-Type-style levels await, with a wide variety of weapons on offer. When you lose a life (even your last life; there are continues on offer as well) you don't lose any of your power-up weaponry, but the restart points are quite far apart. The game's main unique feature is the armoured tail you have, which can be used to ward off attackers and can do considerable damage on its own if well-used.</desc>

		<path>./Saracen (Europe).zip</path>
		<name>Saracen</name>
		<desc>A combination puzzle/action game from Datasoft. In each of the 100 levels, the player moves a crusader through an obstacle filled maze trying to reach the Saracen Chief and detonate a bomb next to him. The chief does not move, instead remaining in a set position. Along the way, he must avoid roaming guards, bouncing cannonballs, and other traps. The crusader is armed with a bow and can pick up directionally specific arrows that are used to stop guards or destroy walls. The arrows being limited to shooting in one of the four compass directions is exacerbated by only being able to carry one object (key, arrow or bomb) at a time. For these reasons, the game's puzzle leanings and the need for a methodical approach are strong. There is generally only one way to solve each level and proper use of the given tools is key to finding it.</desc>

As with so many Dinamic games, the two parts are loaded separately, but the second can't be accessed until a password (provided at the end of part one) is input. Contact with the enemies en route (which are mostly mutant demons) drains your limited energy, and you are also working against a time limit on each section. As well as your magical powers (which are stronger in part two), you can collect swords to attack, as well as lightning bolts which can be collected to destroy all enemies on screen. In part two vanquished foes release coins, which can be spent at shop sections on rechargers, shields and teleporters amongst other things.</desc>

		<desc>Savage contains three different parts, each with its own style. You can play all three, but to get more than one life on levels 2 or 3, you must first input the code earned on completing the previous level. You play Savage, a muscular warrior who was imprisoned in a castle. When he broke free, he found out that his imprisonment had been a trick with the sole purpose of imprisoning his love, the maiden. You have to progress through the 3 parts of the game to rescue her. The first is a simple horizontal-scrolling shooter, in which you use the trajectory of your shots to kill enemies and collect the treasures and improved weapons they drop when killed. The second is a 1st person perspective 3D shooter resembling Space Harrier, with skulls to shoot and monoliths to avoid. In the third you play Savage's Eagle form, flying through platform-style levels avoiding timing-based hazards and shooting anyone who gets in your way. In this section bubbles can be shot to release power-ups</desc>

On the left part of the screen we will find an indicator of radioactive energy that will be very important throughout the game, because, while the indicator is over half, we will be able to destroy the movable enemies when hitting against them, but if it is below this limit will not only not destroy the enemies, but in addition the firings of these will repel the trajectory of our ball.

		<desc>Players take on the role of a scuba driver, and it is up to them to navigate a series of underwater caves in search of their kidnapped friends. While exploring these caves, their air supply depletes so they must go up to the surface to refuel on air. Finding an air tank enables players to swim underwater for a longer period of time. If players have no air left, the game is over. Useful items can be found scattered around the sea floor. These items include keys, which are used to unlock passages; bubble power, which allows players to trap creatures in bubbles which burst; extra speed; and monster suit, which scares off the creatures. Some passages are blocked by walls, and players must use their bubble power to destroy the wall. Between caves, players have to destroy a shark which makes its way across the screen. If players make contact with the shark, their air supply diminishes. When the shark is destroyed, players proceed to the next cave. Later ones have less open surface, trickier passages, and faster creatures.</desc>

		<name>Seas of Blood</name>
		<desc>You are an intrepid pirate captain, commanding the corsair crew of the dread vessel the Banshee through the shipping lanes of Khul's so-called Inland Sea on an avaricious quest: to amass a hold full of lucre through treasure-hunting and outright plunder, transporting it safely through the troubled waters from wretched Tak in the north to the distant southern isle of Nippur. A loose adaptation (using many of the original's locations and situations, but often in new, streamlined ways) of Andrew Chapman's Fighting Fantasy gamebook #16, published earlier the same year, while this computer game version still ignores the gamebooks' Choose-Your-Own-Adventure multiple-choice design in favour of a limited two-word text-game-with-graphics interface, important elements of the FF system rejected in the earlier Adventure Soft conversion of Temple of Terror have been re-integrated into this adaptation -- notably the trademark Fighting Fantasy SKILL &amp; STAMINA RPG stats-management and (simulated) random die-rolling for tracking damage and resolving combat. (Players hoping for the books' third dynamic are, well, out of LUCK.) An additional extraordinary element is carried over from the gamebook: ship-to-ship combat, with your crew manifest standing in to represent an analogue to your boat's STAMINA score (ability to sustain further damage) -- handy to maintain at high levels while attempting to fend off menaces both nautical and land-based drawn from many fabulous and folkloric sources including Homer's Odyssey and the annals of Arabian hero Sinbad the Sailor. The conversion also continues the imposition of the text adventure convention of carry limits unknown in the gamebook, as well as pre-set character stats. Perhaps in an attempt to increase the game's length (at the cost of its replayability), mutually exclusive side-quests from the gamebook all become mandatory stops here toward a larger new goal of not merely maximising one's treasure-accumulation, but systematically denuding the entire coast of anything shiny and not nailed down.</desc>

Watch out for green monsters defending the castle's wall that grab either you or the block flying up. If five blocks are on the see-saw at once, it will become immobilized. Lives are lost when you are grabbed by a green monster or when a block crushes you. The object of the game is to fly to the top of the castle and defeat the evil lord.</desc>

		<desc>Shadow Dancer is a one-player game in which you control Shinobi. With the help of your dog, you must kill your enemies while you venture through locations such as airports, railroads, waterfalls, sewers, and more. Furthermore, you must find and disarm several bombs along the way before you leave each. You also have the option of using magic against enemies, which may consist of tornadoes or fireballs. There are five missions you must complete; and each one has different objectives such as obstructing the enemies deadly mission, disrupting the enemy's supply route, raiding the enemy's industrial units, attacking the enemy's underground forces, and liberating and securing the shuttle's base. Each mission consists of three stages and there is a boss on each of the mission's final stages. What's good about the dog, you say? Well, if you tell it to, the dog will maul enemies (provided that the dog barks at them when you face them) and distract them long enough so that you can shoot at them. Remember that you have a limited time to do this, as the enemy will eventually kick the dog off him. This causes the dog to yelp and shrink, making him powerless against them.</desc>

		<desc>While very young, Aarbron was kidnapped and enslaved by the Priests of the Beast Lord. He grew up on drugs made to destroy his own will and turn him into the Beast Messenger, a powerful creature serving Maletoth, The Beast Lord himself. He did his job, until one day he noticed a man about to be sacrificed in a ritual, his face triggering ancient memories... and as the sacrificial knife descended into the man's body, Aarbron recognizes the face. Of his father. As his father dies in the altar, memories of his childhood and tormented past at the hands of the Beast Lord emerged, and as feelings of hate over his captors took over him, he swore revenge and fled the temple, knowing the road to avenge his father and redemption would be hard. Shadow of the Beast, one of Psygnosis most popular titles during the 16-bit computer era is a side-scrolling platformer best known for the use of parallax scrolling along lush graphics, a musical score by David Whittaker, a iconic cover by Roger Dean and what many consider to be unforgiving gameplay, balancing between the "very challenging" and the "impossible". The player has to navigate through several areas filled with enemies and traps, collecting keys and activating triggers than open new areas or give Aarbron the means to overcome a sub-boss. The number of moves the player has at disposal is limited: duck, jump and only two attacks: punch and a flying kick. While most enemies die with just one hit, the player must time each attack accurately. However, there are also traps of objects that cannot be destroyed, and these require the player to jump, duck or move according the sequence. The player has only one life with 12 hit points that can be replenished by collecting some objects hidden in the level (like an off-route location or a under a megalith), which also contributes to the difficulty level.</desc>

		<desc>Shadow Warriors is a direct port of the arcade version of Ninja Gaiden. It is a beat'em up in the veins of Double Dragon featuring Ryu Hayabusa, a ninja who must fight members of an evil cult who seek to fulfil Nostradamus' end of the world prophecies. Ryu Hayabusa can attack his enemies using his his bare hands and feet or using a sword (for a limited time). He can also perform moves such as a flying neck throw, a back flip and hang kicks, performed while hanging in scenario objects. Throwing enemies against objects such as phone cabins, oil drums or dumpsters will destroy them, revealing power ups such as health items and swords. At some points, Ryu will have to perform acrobatic moves to carry on. He has a life bar starting with 5 units. The game takes place in United States' locations such as Las Vegas, North Carolina, Los Angeles, the Grand Canyon and Brooklyn. The enemies in those stages are mostly of the same 5 kinds, including Jason Vorhees' look-alikes and other masked men. There is a boss fight at the end of each stage. A two-player co-operative game is also featured. Whenever the player dies, a continue screen will appear showing Ryu chained to a table while a circular saw descends upon him.</desc>

		<desc>General Zoff is holding Ambassador Kryxix captive in his spaceship. Plans for a new type of spaceship are hidden in a micro-disc embedded in the Ambassador's spine. If Zoff had the plans, the empire would be in great danger, and it is only a matter of time until his inquisitors will discover them. The Emperor has assembled the so-called "enigma team", a group of six reckless mercenaries, to take care of the situation. Players take control of all six mercenaries and have one hour and forty minutes to rescue Ambassador Kryxix and capture General Zoff. All six characters have different abilities. Syylk is an insectoid and a strong fighter, Zark Montor, the team leader, is an expert in unarmed combat and the only translator of the group, Servina Maris is the only character who can pick locks, Torik is an avian with thorough knowledge of explosives, Maul is a slow combat droid and Manto is a weak droid, but the only team member that can operate the transporter that is vital for the mission's success. Controls are completely icon based and the screen is divided into six sections. The upper screen section is called the mission command screen and displays which character is active, the active character's location and the status of all characters: whether they are moving, engaged in combat, weak or dying or performing certain action such as picking locks. The lower half of the screen changes depending on the situation and shows additional information and all selectable actions. From the main game screen (enigma team screen) players can choose one of the six characters and access four sub-screens: Character status screen: Shows a character's speed, strength, stamina (health) and carried weight. Object screen: Shows all objects present at a location as well as all objects carried by the selected character. It can be used to drop or pick up items, equip weapons and items or use special items. Movement screen: Here, the active character can be moved by clicking on arrows that show possible directions for a character to move. Battle screen: During battles, characters can scan the location to count and identify their enemies, move, attack with their equipped weapon, defend or retreat.</desc>

You are armed with a limited amount of ammo plus a few Molotov Cocktails to throw - both of these can be replenished from bonus items. As well as on the streets, enemies also appear in cars and through windows (there's a special bonus for shooting these). At the end of each level you meet an informant, who must not be shot, as this destroys the entire level of work.</desc>

		<name>Short Circuit</name>
		<desc>A freak bolt of lightning has made Robot 5 gain human feelings, and his makers at Nova Robotics are keen to open him up and find out how this happened. 5 therefore feels desperate to escape, and survive in the wider world. The game is split into two parts, which differ from the Commodore 64 game of the same name, and can each be played independently. The first is viewed in third-person 3D, as our hero moves from room to room through various doors. Objects can be picked up to allow him to jump and fire. You can use objects in your possession, take them by searching desks, or link to some of the available computers to use their functionality. In the second stage, armed with jumping and shooting abilities, Number 5 must simply escape as quickly as he can. Guards and Other robots are giving chase, and should be shot. Your robot becomes increasingly depressed when he kills wildlife, and this can eventually cost you a life, so make sure you jump or duck around them.</desc>

		<desc>One puck, and only two competitors. One is the computer, and the other is, of course, you. You get a chance to match your skills at this Air Hockey style game, over 'Cantina Band' inspired music. Deflect the puck around the walled area using your bat, trying to knock it into your opponent's goal. There are several competitors, from which some of them definitely cheat, so be prepared to be laughed at. However, you can cheat as well, as you can resize your stick to fill the whole table width, or add one in the middle, and see who breaks glass first. There are single plays or the tournament where you play opponents in order of difficulty. The winner is the one who reaches 15 glassbreaks first.</desc>

		<desc>Silkworm is a classic horizontally-scrolling shoot-em-up based on the 1988 Tecmo arcade game. The main difference between this game and many other side-scrolling shoot-em-ups is that you got to be on land as well as in the air. Player 1 would play as a helicopter, but if a second player joined the game, they would play as a jeep. Both players would have to protect each other as well as themselves. After a certain number of kills, a "goose" helicopter would form on the screen. If the players managed to destroy it they would get a weapons powerup. This would go on throughout the entire game (a "goose" could appear even during the end of level baddie!).</desc>

Earthquakes, floods and fires are all emergency situations that must be dealt to contain any damage.

The sharping air of the North threat with tearing the clothes of the great horseman, "Sir Fred". His rabid preoccupation for the kidnapping of the princess whom he loves does not appear reflected in his imperturbable expression. He only stops for a moment, with a fleeting blowing to fix, like an arrow, his glance on the walls of the castle and to tighten the teeth with desperation. He never faced so many and so big dangers. In each bend, in each stay of the great castle of Beni-Gómez it's awaiting him, threatening, the death. But there is no space for the doubt nor to lie down back. The decision is already taken. The ground runs, it almost flies under the firm and implacable push of his feet... Guide Sir Fred, through the different rooms of the castle, until finding his beloved princess. Take into account that she can be prisoner in different stays, and pay attention to the objects you can find on the way; they will help you to avoid the dangers which are distributed through all the adventure.</desc>

		<desc>In this Manic Miner variant Sir Lancelot is exploring a castle in the hope of finding treasures. He must navigate his way through 24 platform screens (in a predefined order on the Spectrum but in any order on the Amstrad), collecting every object on each one to reveal the exit within a time limit. There are enemies on fixed attack paths to avoid - Lancelot has no weapon but can jump, and survive any length of fall. Avoiding contact is thus a case of jumping out of their way, and using lower ledges to strategically time his moves. There are sections you can freely climb but not descend, so timing and forward planning are important. Contact with any of these costs one of your four lives, and resets the screen to its starting position.</desc>

		<path>./Skate Crazy (Europe).zip</path>
		<name>Skate Crazy</name>
		<desc>Pull on your skates and get down to the local car park where your prowess on eight wheels is put to the test in the 'Car Park Challenge'. The player grooves his way around one level of the car park which has been turned into a multidirectionally scrolling arena for the gladiators of roller racing. Kick cans over, litter to collect and obstacles to avoid in the shape of cones, ramps, sand, bouncing balls, flying frisbees, mazes of tyres and rocks, and even other skaters. Finishing each level is a battle against time to negotiate a series of gates in a set order, the next gate being signified by a row of dots which flash between its flags. To complete rounds successfully, though, suitably impressive stunts and tricks are carried out to appease a set of four judges. Each have a card which they periodically display at the bottom of the screen, notifying the player of his progress. When the player's energetic jumping skills have gained enough points to qualify, he skates through the finishing gate and has his performance rated. Failing to qualify forces the player to skate around the car park against the clock, picking up a set number of pieces of litter. Beating a level allows the player to skate to the level's exit ramp, from where he chooses to move up to the next level or leave the car park and move onto the next part of the game, 'The Skate Crazy Championship Course'. This section of the game is a race against time over four horizontally scrolling cityscapes of platforms and ramps, with the player building up speed on his skates using a paced joystick waggling movement. Ground level obstacles and gaps in the floor are crossed with leaps of controllable strength and items at head height are avoided by judicious ducking. Birds and other creatures also spell doom for the heroic skater, unless he is able to avoid them or throw things at them. Points are scored in this section by picking up extra skating paraphernalia, such as pads, clothes, skates and litter.</desc>

Before taking off you can visit Rodney's skate shop to buy equipment. The first event is freestyle, in which your aim is to score as many points as possible in 10 attempts. Judges determine how much style and skill you have shown. The High Jump uses the same equipment, only this time your task is to jump as high as possible at the end of the ramp. The downhill events are overhead-view races. In the Downhill Race you simply try to complete the course within 90 seconds. In the Downhill Jam you try to outperform a human or computer opponent whilst dodging or jumping hazards. You can use attacking moves to either remove hazards or knock your opponent over. The pool joust is more of a one-on-one beat em up using a stick, set within a pit to skate around.</desc>

		<desc>Fight as either Red Beard or One Eye through various pirate themed levels, like ships and forts, and even some non-pirate themed levels, battling ninjas, skeletons, and others in a quest to get back your hard earned money from an evil wizard. You can also fight side by side with a friend (who controls the pirate you didn't choose). Fighting works like fencing, with a few different moves to use, including parrying. The levels scroll through with a boss at the end of each. You gain money by vanquishing foes and digging for treasure where X marks the spot.</desc>

		<desc>The Skweeks lived in harmony for centuries, being a naturally peaceful peoples, until Pitark arrived. He ruined their bright pink land by removing the colour, and it was only after he died that they had the opportunity to clean the land up. Your job is to travel through the 99 continents and clean each one in sequence. Skweek can move in each of the four compass directions, and is armed with a simple weapon, whose shots rebound around before they hit one of Pitark's minions, the Schnoreuls - contact with which is instantly fatal. Some squares contain arrows which force you in a particular direction, while there are also blockades to avoid. Bomb squares blow up surrounding squares but give you time to move away from them as they do this, while Shortcut squares allow you to move to another teleport-type square by pushing the joystick in its direction.</desc>

Skyfox is complete with deflection shields, laser cannons, five guided and five heat-seeking missiles and a top speed of Mach IV. The 15 scenarios can be played at 5 skill levels. You will have to fight tanks, enemy planes and the mothership. Use the radar to locate enemy vehicles, and the long-range scanner to ensure that no wave reaches your base before you can take it out. Keep an eye on your shields, and on fuel levels - you can dock at the base to refuel.</desc>

		<desc>A simple enough futuristic sports game that isn't a world away from Marble Madness. You control a ball over a futuristic landscape, the idea being to find the puck that's hidden somewhere in the level and "herd" it back to your starting point. Sounds simple enough, except for one thing, there's another player (either computer or human) trying to do the same thing. This results in incredibly hectic gameplay. Add this to the fact that sometimes you're negatively charged to the puck (and thus kick it away) or positively charged (so the puck sticks to you) and you're in for a crazy time!</desc>

In Slightly Magic you are cast as Slightly - mischievous nephew of legendary wizard Bigwiz, who has suddenly taken off on some urgent business, leaving his castle in disarray with dragons and magical spells running amok. One of the dragons kidnaps the princess, and now Slightly has to save her. In addition to standard inventory puzzles of Dizzy games, Slightly Magic introduces a magic system that requires multiple objects to be combined in order to achieve effects ranging from frightening the enemies to turning the player into a fish.</desc>

		<name>Smash T.V.</name>
		<desc>The year is 1999. The world's most popular television show is Smash T.V., an ultra-violent contest between two armed-to-the-teeth combatants, set loose in a series of deadly arenas that are filled to bursting with hordes of mindless beasts and killer robots. The aim of the game is to blast everything in sight and try to grab more cash and prizes than the other guy. Toaster ovens, VCRs, fancy cars and luxury holidays are there for the taking... for anyone who can survive long enough to enjoy them. Smash T.V. is an insane shoot-em-up from the brain of Eugene Jarvis, creator of Robotron: 2084. It retains that game's frantic style of play and two-joystick control method, but adds plenty of gore, violence, a hint of satire and that all-important two player mode.</desc>

You can choose between 2 levels of difficulty: beginner (less enemy attacks) or expert (the most dangerous). The weather will affect the mission. The good weather will be great for training, and the stormy will be dangerous but great for attacks, as you can hide into the clouds and approach the enemy unnoticed. You'll have a copilot that will help you telling what's going on every moment. You can avoid missiles using your skills, using chaff or... if you can't, you can use your parachute!</desc>

Score three goals to reach the next level - initially you will face another soccer-based table with more defenders. Other football-themed elements include 'throw-in' positions from the side and pop-up players to toggle for points. On the Amiga version, the later tables have a casino and gambling as a theme. Gameplay is fundamentally the same - hit the correct targets in sequence to advance, with other targets adding to your score.</desc>

		<desc>You play Xain, the Soldier of Light who must visit a number of invaded planets and wipe out the evil hordes that have attacked the human populations. The main bulk of the gameplay is a horizontally scrolling shoot em up, putting you in control of Xain, who can jump or duck to avoid enemies and jump up to higher ledges. Lots of extra weaponry can be collected along the way, although this is lost when one of your five lives is lost. The planets Lagto, Cleemans and Cleemalt are all available for selection immediately. These each have their own settings  Cleedos is desert, Cleemalt cavernous and Lagto lush and verdant. After completing each planet you must successfully fly to the next one.</desc>

You think of it as a nightmare, but then a bullet almost hits you. Just then you find a pistol in your bag, if these dudes are real, why shouldn't it be real too? Solo is another of the Opera games designed to be used with the Gun Stick, quite similar on its development to Opera's Trigger.

		<desc>Solomon's Key is a platform game with both action and strategy elements. On each level your goal is to retrieve a key which can then be used to unlock the exit. To help out, you have a magic wand which can be used to create and destroy blocks (though some blocks can't be destroyed). In order to reach the key you will need carefully to arrange the blocks on the screen so you can jump your way around safely. Wandering around each level are a variety of enemies which will cause you to lose a life if you're caught. Some creatures can be killed by destroying the block they are standing on, others must be dodged. Hidden bonuses and magic can be found on many of the levels, sometimes even hidden in blocks. Some treasures give you bonus points, others can form magic spells to help deal with the enemies. To make the game more difficult, each level has a time limit in which it must be completed.</desc>

		<path>./Sorcerer Lord (Europe).zip</path>
		<name>Sorcerer Lord</name>
		<desc>Sorcerer Lord is a medieval fantasy game of tactical warfare. The evil Shadowlord's army is threatening to overrun the peaceful country of Galanor. The alliance of races in Galanor isn't very fond of suppression, slavery or extinction, so they are preparing for war -- it's your job to coordinate the Galanorian defense. Movement and combat are turn-based. You and the Shadowlord alternately recruit new troops, move armies on a 2D hex-map of the land and try to conquer the enemies garrisons. The outcome of fights is shown as plain text only. Although the gameplay is quite simple, there are a few tactical knacks like certain races fighting more fiercely in certain terrain types, fatigue levels and basic statistics for army leaders. Despite the game's title, magic is a rather unimportant element of chance in battles and not under your direct control. The game contains a time limit; you've got 40 turns in easy level, less in advanced levels.</desc>

		<desc>Set during the collapse of the Soviet Union, this arcade style game puts the player in control of a Soviet tank. This tank must explore the areas of Vilnius and Baku and rescue all Russian citizens. Meanwhile, the rebel armies will attack with everything they have. The game uses an overhead view of the battlefield and multi-directional scroll. The gameplay is reminiscent of games like SWIV, but the need to rescue a certain number of hostages to complete the level adds a limited strategy element: the goal of the game is not to defeat the enemies, a task literally impossible as they re-spawn within seconds, but to rescue the hostages before being blown up.</desc>

		<desc>Space Crusade is a science fiction strategy game converted from the Games Workshop/Milton Bradley boardgame, in which you control a commander and four marines who are sent on different missions aboard hostile alien starships. Your commander starts off as a sergeant, but he can work his way through the ranks. The game allows three players, each commanding one marine chapter each. The alien team is `played` by the computer. The game is a literal conversion of the board game in the same vein as Gremlin's earlier Hero Quest. It can be best described as a turn-based board game in which the player must fulfill the primary and secondary objectives to complete the mission, which usually involves elimination of entire alien force on board or destruction of mothership etc. This game features unique 3D close-ups during the battle scenes, a feature which was later adopted by games like the X-Com series.</desc>

		<desc>Magic Knight's second game (after Finders Keepers) sees him travelling through time to rescue 8 people including his tutor Gimbal, who have become locked in time thanks to a faulty spell. The game invented a whole new control system, essentially pioneering the use of icons and windows in adventure games. You control a pointing finger, which can be moved onto each of the menus to reveal sub-menus, which contain the main options for object manipulation. All objects can be examined in detail, which produces a visual display of them, and possible clues as to their usage. You must look after your character's health and energy levels - carrying too many objects will progressively weaken him. You must also look after and direct the trapped characters once you locate them.</desc>

		<desc>(From the instruction manual) Welcome to the world of the Enchanter saga - a world founded on magic, where guilds of magicians have mastered the powers of sorcery; a world now threatened with destruction. You distinguished yourself among the young Enchanters by defeating the evil warlock Krill, whose attempt to subjugate the land was thwarted by your cleverness, as your inexperience allowed you to succeed where others might have failed. This earned you a place on the Circle of Enchanters, second only to the great Belboz the Necromancer. Then Belboz himself was nearly destroyed, and your rescue of him from the evil demon Jeearr earned you the ultimate honor given a mage, the leadership of the Circle of Enchanters. Now, a crisis has befallen the kingdom. Magic itself seems to be failing. Spells fail to work or go strangely awry, the populace is confused and restive, and even the Enchanters Guild is baffled. A great conclave of the Guildmasters is ordained, and it is at this conclave that the final conflict between good and evil begins to unfold. Difficulty Level: Expert Original Grey Box Contains: Frobozz Magic - Magic Equipment Catalog, Enchanter's Guild Pin, Enchanter trading cards</desc>

The game is viewed isometrically, which means that the controls are rotated through 90 degrees - this, coupled with the fact that many screens have huge gaps and diagonal paths, means that it's hard to get far at first. Falling off ledges loses you time, which is very limited to start with Gerald must collect energy crystals throughout his journey - which can also be shortened by using a complex system of lifts.

Its author, an evil warlock and our main enemy, has adopted the form of an eagle and has also requested help of a legion of ghosts, monsters, demons, werewolves and other kinds of despicable creatures, that will try to avoid that we can reach their master. Once we get started, our immediate goal will consist in the following: In the first place, as every classic magician, we should go in search of our crystal ball. Once we have it, we are going to be able to see which are the movements of all the relevant personages in the story (the young lady, the armor and the eagle), also, it's going to show us where are the resting two elements required for our adventure: the magic wand (with which we will counter-enchant the girl) and the book of spells (essential to break the spell of the armor). Here it is where the graphical innovations of the program will occupy the an important place in the game. All these monitorings above mentioned are possible because the screen is divided in two zones. In the superior part we will see the adventures of our personage. Simultaneously, in the inferior zone, there will appear the exact place of the castle in which the object or personage we are looking for is located.</desc>

		<desc>This flight simulation sets you as a young Spitfire pilot in 1940, when World War 2 is hotting up in the skies over the south of England. The program is viewed from within the cockpit, with the instrument panel viewed by pressing Space. The pilot will have to co-ordinate landing gear, brakes and ruddering, and use a map to navigate and find targets. Loops, rolls and split-S moves are all incorporated in the simulation logic. The game can generate random combat situations - for example, 6 enemies 10 miles away, 1500 feet into the air. Once you have established a strong flight record you can take on the missions. Additionally there are practice modes for both flying and combat.</desc>

		<desc>Sliding block puzzle games were one of the many non-electronic forms of entertainment re-made with new twists for the digital age. The basic premise involves being presented with 1 of 10 pictures (representing famous figures such as Ronald Reagan, Maggie Thatcher, Lady Diana and even Sir Clive Sinclair), with the complete picture presented at the side of the screen. You must move your cursor onto the, pick up a piece, and place it onto the main playing area, ensuring that you can move the others into place. Unlike with the plastic versions there are 16 pieces to fit into 20 spaces, allowing more leeway in terms of continual sliding. The complications in this version include gaps in the playing area which swallow pieces and return them to the bank, a time limit, bombs which have to be moved off the screen to avoid losing a life, and bonus objects to be moved in specific ways for bonus points.</desc>

		<desc>As an experienced ghoul-chaser, you think you can handle anything when you get a call to explore a haunted mansion. You soon realize that you're wrong, however, and you'll need all of your skills to deal with 384 screens of spookiness. It's an arcade adventure, with ghosts to avoid as they cause your character to fall off course, sometimes down a screen or two. Collecting bugs and beetles allows you to use one of the cauldrons to produce spells to kill enemies. You have 4 minutes on each life, although more can be picked up from the many egg-timers around the screens. The game keeps track of your 'Scaredyness factor' and adjusts the game difficulty to help struggling players accordingly. The eventual target is to collect items to turn into letters - earning enough of these allows you to play a Hangman game against the 'spooky old man'.</desc>

		<name>Sporting Triangles</name>
		<desc>A licensed version of a British TV game show from the late 1980s. The game features 3 players, all either human or computer. Each chooses a category of questions out of 12 on offer - some are for a single sport (such as soccer or cricket) while others a more general (such as Indoor Sport and Pot Luck). Four of the seven rounds involve each player being asked a question, which could be from one of the 3 selected categories, or it could be general sport. A die is rolled, and the colour of its final position on the board indicates the type of question.

The Jigsaw round involves identifying a club crest, pitch for a particular sport or similar, with a piece added to the picture after each incorrect guess. Again the score declines the more guesses you need. There's an 'on the buzzer' questions round at the end.</desc>

		<desc>A licensed version of a British TV game show from the late 1980s. The game features 3 players, all either human or computer. Each chooses a category of questions out of 12 on offer - some are for a single sport (such as soccer or cricket) while others a more general (such as Indoor Sport and Pot Luck). Four of the seven rounds involve each player being asked a question, which could be from one of the 3 selected categories, or it could be general sport. A die is rolled, and the colour of its final position on the board indicates the type of question. The other 3 rounds include Hit For Six, in which you get a succession of clues and have to work out which of the 6 named people they refer to - get it as quickly as you can to maximize your score. The Jigsaw round involves identifying a club crest, pitch for a particular sport or similar, with a piece added to the picture after each incorrect guess.

		<name>Spy Hunter</name>
		<desc>A conversion of the arcade game, Spy Hunter is a driving action game played from an overhead point of view. Your car is equipped with machine guns to help you get past the numerous enemies out on the road (be careful not to shoot any civilians, though!) Occasionally you will come across a weapons van, and if you drive into the back of the van your car becomes equipped with a second weapon (such as smoke screen, oil slick, or missiles.) At several points the road splits and you can enter a boathouse which transforms your car into a boat temporarily. If you drive far enough the seasons change as well (watch out for icy conditions during winter!) The enemy cars will do anything to stop you, including running you off the road, firing guns from the back of a limmo, or dropping bombs from a helicopter.</desc>

		<desc>As Mike the Spy, you must explore several European countries, in search of some all-important plans. This will involve getting onto a plane using fake ID, flying without a plane to Switzerland, and then onto Venice. Objects you will encounter include an umbrella, an onion, and a fishing line. This adventure is written using GAC (Graphic Adventure Creator); as such, most of the screen features visual representations of your surroundings, with text input at the bottom of the screen. Commands are object-sensitive - if you have just GETted a hat, WEAR IT will mean 'WEAR HAT'. The standard commands are joined by a few which you will only need in one situation. Simple directional commands (w, s, up and so on) are used less frequently than in most IF games.</desc>

		<desc>Ricky Steel is a feared renegade with a mechanical arm to fire bullets, and his Class A101 armoured yet amphibious Nightwind car is Stainless. He lives in a Mad Max-inspired world, but Dr. Vardos has sent a horde of androids to destroy it. Take control of Steel and stop this, in this Spy Hunter-style vertically scrolling road-based shooter. The game is split into four sections. You begin on foot, and must travel up the screen to reach the Nightwind. Helicopters and other foes must be shot or avoided, and their bullets avoided. You then enter your vehicle and drive up the screen, dealing with similar hazards. The controls involve pushing forward to accelerate and pushing down to reverse. Level 2 involves taking to the water, attacking submarines using bombs. The final showdown involves hunting down and killing Vardos, despite the attentions of animal-shaped asteroids and other hazards. The scanner along the bottom of the screen is crucial to spotting foes as they approach. You have a limited shield, turned on and off by pressing space, and limited fuel which is recharged by collecting fuel circles which float by.</desc>

The games are designed so that you can ease into play, familiarizing yourself with menus, options and player controls. The Alliance and Hierarchy each possess different types of warships. Each vessel has its own maneuvering and firing characteristics, plus a unique special power that you can employ when circumstances dictate. The game has two modules: the Melee, in which you can simply blast the computer or another player to smithereens using one of 16 different ships, in either Hierarchy or Alliance fleets; or, should you wish for a more challenging game, lets you play one of 9 preset scenarios.</desc>

		<desc>The arcade game from Atari based on the third Star Wars movie features three action sequences inspired by the film. First, you control Princess Leia on a speeder bike racing through the forests on Endor. You have to evade trees and deal with enemy troopers by shooting at them or luring them into Ewok traps. In the second sequence, you control Chewbacca who has captured an Imperial AT-ST Walker, evading tree traps and shooting at enemy walkers. In this sequence, the perspective sometimes switches to the Millennium Falcon which you must guide through a fleet of enemy Star Destroyers and TIE Fighters. In the final sequence, the Millennium Falcon enters the Death Star and has to make its way to the reactor, surviving more TIE Fighters and laser turrets. Once the reactor is destroyed, you have to get out again before the explosion engulfs the ship. After the Death Star has been destroyed, the game restarts at the first sequence, but with a higher difficulty.</desc>

Skyfox is complete with deflection shields, laser cannons, five guided and five heat-seeking missiles and a top speed of Mach IV. The 15 scenarios can be played at 5 skill levels. You will have to fight tanks, enemy planes and the mothership. Use the radar to locate enemy vehicles, and the long-range scanner to ensure that no wave reaches your base before you can take it out.

		<desc>The Planet Novenia has been attacked by the Egrons, who snuck in by disguising their craft as the protected Starglider species, which Novenia's automated defenses were programmed not to shoot. Your task is to fight them off using only an obsolete Airborne Ground Attack Vehicle. This was designed as the ultimate combat machine, with sophisticated hardware up to Draziw Yarg's high standards. It has a fully-rechargeable shield, plasma drive unit, an inbuilt scanner and 10,000-sector map, a top speed of 2550 Urads and two homing missiles. The game is viewed from within AGAV's cockpit, with control over speed, weapon targeting and firing. There are several control options to decide exactly how the craft works, with fixed or floating sighting, and the option of automatic centering, allowing you to balance the game between easy sighting and advanced shooting ranges. Repair depots must be visited frequently, as they can refill the weapon bays as well as repairing the ship. Crucially, the Egron Stargliders need 3 missiles to shoot down, so at least 1 visit to a depot is required to complete this job, at which point you move up to the next, harder, level.</desc>

There are 243 sectors to correct, each representing a year. After selecting one, you are involved in first-person space dogfighting, viewed from within your cockpit. Pay attention to your multi-directional scanner to locate ships and mines. There are also indicators for your fuel and oxygen levels, pitch and yaw, and engine temperature. Shot enemies release letters, which must then be flown over. Once an area is cleared, you must use the letters to form a word. Then, fly through the time gate, and decide which historical event the word relates to.</desc>

		<desc>As BLOB, the Bio-Logically Operated Being, you are sent into an unstable planet and charged with the task of preventing it from exploding. This involves collecting various items (the exact combination is different every time you load the game) and taking them to the planet's core. The game is an arcade adventure viewed from the side, with 512 screens arranged in a 16x32 pattern. A teleport system exists, so once you find the codes you can get quick access to different parts of the game. The creatures to avoid are intelligent, getting tougher to predict as you get closer to the centre, but you are armed with a gun and can also try to avoid them. BLOB has a set of platforms which can be used to allow limited vertical movement, but these disappear after a few seconds each use.</desc>

		<name>Starstrike II</name>
		<desc>In Realtime's previous Starstrike game (not to be confused with Star Strike), the evil Outsiders attacked the Federation and had to be forced back. This time, the boot's on the other foot, as the Federation have sent their Starstrike II vehicles in to take them out. Armed with sophisticated computers, lasers and shields, all it needs is a good pilot, such as yourself. Twenty-two planets fall under Outsiders control, and each has grid-based defenses which must be taken out, complete with all their command computers and production droids. The planets are split into five groups, each of which can be chosen at the start of the game. The combat is intense, and aims to create the likely feel of space combat, with lots of ducking and weaving to set up shots. The game features filled-in graphics, unlike the Elite-esque wireframes of the first game.</desc>

		<name>Stationfall</name>
		<desc>(From Infocom Home Page site) After the fall of the Second Galactic Union in 1716 GY, a ten-thousand-year dark age settled upon the galaxy. Interstellar travel was nonexistent, and many star systems descended into a near-barbaric state, buring coal and gas for energy, and growing food directly from exposed topsoil. In 11,203 GY, a treaty between the Empires of Tremain and Galium formed the Third Galactic Union. Ships of the Stellar Patrol (a pseudo-military wing of the Union government on Tremain) began exploring the galaxy, searching for the human civilizations that are the remnants of the Second Galactic Union. You are a native of the planet Gallium, one of the most politically powerful but culturally barren worlds in the Union. Your great-great-grandfather was a founding officer of the Stellar Patrol, and for five generations, your family has served in the Patrol. It was always taken for granted that you would sign up as soon as you came of age. Once in the Patrol, you discovered that the exciting career promised in all the Patrol recruitment brochures was nonsense. Your life was drudgery and demerits. The one time you got to see an exotic planet was right after a big parade, when they needed a detail to sweep up all the confetti. Then came your big moment: shipwrecked on a seemingly deserted world, you met an exuberant robotic companion named Floyd. Together, the two of you discovered the secret of that mysterious planet, Resida, and saved it from near destruction. As a result of your heroics, you were offered, and quickly accepted, a juicy promotion. Good-bye Ensign Seventh Class -- hello Lieutenant First Class! No more scrubwork! No more bathroom details! No more cleaning groth cages! Finally, your life in the Stellar Patrol would be as exciting as those brochures had promised! Oh, how naive you'd been. Your daily routine simply replaced tedious scrubwork with tedious paperwork. Since your planetfall on Resida, five long years have dragged by, without a single event worthy of note. Why, just look at today's "thrilling" assignment: scooting over to Space Station Gamma Delta Gamma 777-G 59/59 Sector Alpha-Mu-79 to pick up a supply of Request for Stellar Patrol Issue Regulation Black Form Binders Request Form Forms...</desc>

		<name>Steve Davis Snooker</name>
		<desc>Mike Lamb recreated the basic rules of the popular English game of snooker in this simulation, which can be played by one or two players, but has no computer opponent as such, unlike the later 16-bit remake. Instead, you are scored based not only on how many points you score legitimately, but also on how many points you concede through foul shots, and how many shots you take in total. You always take the next shot, even if you've missed or fouled, so in a one player game the break-building strategies can be slightly more aggressive than in a real match, as there's no risk of leaving an opponent a chance As in the real game you start off by trying to pot a red (there are 10 or the real 15, depending on which mode you choose), and if successful choosing one of the 6 colours (by pressing the number corresponding to its points value). Once you've lined up the direction of the shot, you will have to set the speed, and then the spin.</desc>

		<desc>Count Chameleon recognises the importance of the game of cricket to the power of the British Empire, and knows that a simple Rubbertronic Ray to scupper the ball's bounce is all it takes to bring their power down. You control the team of Viscount Stifflip, Professor Braindeath, Colonel R G Bargie and Miss Primbottom, as they attempt to stop him. The bulk of the game is icon-driven, and allows you to switch between the four characters at will. The control options are all described in slangy English terms, so instead of talking to characters you 'Chinwag' with them, and fights are called 'Fisticuffs'. These are a key aspect of the game, requiring prompt arcade reactions and correct move selection, especially as using the low blow too often results in a character being wiped out.</desc>

		<desc>Stormbringer is the fourth and final game to star Magic Knight, and the only one to make it onto 16-bit systems. Magic Knight must meet with his alter-ego, the Off-White Knight, by reaching his castle hideout - which means clearing 64 screens of adventure. As with the rest of the series, the game uses a largely visual system, in which a press of the fire button calls up a menu of options, such as 'examine', 'pick up' or 'cast spell. Selecting these calls up a sub-menu to choose what should be examined or thrown, which objects to combine, which spells to cast, and so on. The objects to be used include a chicken, a disguise and eggs. One new feature is that bolts of lightning are fired down at Magic Knight from the sky, and these must be avoided.</desc>

You, in a space suit and with a laser gun, have to regain control of a factory located in Outer Space. The factory, where robots are produced, has been taken over by aliens and they are reprogramming the robots to take over planet Earth. To take over control of the factory you have to reach the central Control Room but to get there you have to overcome many obstacles and collect several objects. These objects can be used to perform several tasks of which some must be done before you take over the computer by stopping it. Fuel and patches for your suit can be picked up and retrieve items such as rings and spanners, which are given out by robots or just left around on the floor. Strange Loop has an option to save and load the current game status.</desc>

Many of these characters, such as Adon, Gen, and Birdie, are later seen in the Street Fighter Alpha series. After each country you will have the chance to get additional points in a little bonus round, a feature seen later in most Street Fighter games. The final boss in the game is Sagat, who is the second to the last boss in Street Fighter 2. The goal is to become the greatest fighter in the world. As with most tournament fighting games once you have defeated the boss the game will reset and start from the beginning with a harder difficulty level. It is possible to start a two player game but there will be only one fight (between the two players) which will determine who will travel the globe to fight the computer controlled opponents.</desc>

		<name>Street Hawk</name>
		<desc>After an intensive 18-month research program, Jesse Mach's super bike is finally ready to hit the mean streets. Jesse has vowed to avenge the death of his best friend, and goes on a mission to take down the villains whether they may be. But Jesse need not look no further than the street. The baddies are driving XR3's, so all it would take is one laser blast in the XR3 fuel tank, and the cars are immobilized. Zooming along, the player has to serve through traffic, dodging the bullets fired by the bad guys and eliminating carloads of criminals while taking care not to kill innocent citizens. As well as the built-in lasers, Jesse's bike can leap into the air, and a well-timed spring can avoid a collision. A crash or a blast from a villain's gun is not fatal, as the bike can take a fair bit of damage before it is immobilized. Reckless driving is not tolerated, and if too many civilians are killed, the police will be in pursuit. If the police catches up with the bike, the game ends. However, the turbo facility can be used to make a quick getaway. After driving along, the player needs to keep an eye on the gauges that indicate the condition of the lasers, the damage inflicted on the bike, and the engine temperature. Points are awarded for each of the villain's car blown up and for each civilian overtaken. While driving, Jesse receives a message regarding a break-in at the liquor store. It is up to him to take it slowly so that he can arrive there safely. At the liquor store, you must destroy three villains who run out of the store and attempt to escape in their getaway van. All of the villains must be shot before the second mission can begin. This mission involves another chase sequence, only this time a high bonus is awarded for killing off a major underworld figure who is driving a black sedan. Once the sedan gets destroyed, Jesse and his bike can return to base for a refit so the major confrontation with the leader can begin. To complete the game, the leader must be blown out of his Porsche.</desc>

Four different courts are provided - the schoolyard, the alleyway, the parking lot and the backyard. Each of these has its own hazards to play around, such as oil slicks and potholes. The standard basketball dunks, passes and steals are on offer. An opposition player drilling the ball into you sees you gain possession. One or two players can join in, choosing their team of 3 from the 10 kids you are offered, each with different abilities. There are 3 computer difficulty levels.</desc>

		<desc>The Enemy has kidnapped the world's top computer scientists, and is intent on cracking into your supercomputer. Strike Force Cobra must penetrate his hideout, crack his computer codes, and rescue the scientists before any of this can be done. To crack the code you use a DLB (Digital Lock Breaker) which is more effective when more numbers have been found, and the scientists give these when rescued. Your team of four members of varying nationalities is chosen from a pool of 8, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. The game is viewed isometrically, and you move the characters (one at a time) through the lair, shooting down intruders and clearing any traps for the other members to go through.</desc>

		<name>Strike Force Harrier</name>
		<desc>Rod Hyde was always determined to produce the most realistic and advanced flight simulations ever, and this early attempt at recreating the Harrier is an example of that. There are 3 skill levels, as well as two practice modes - one for the rudiments of flight and the other for combat. The action-centered nature of the title means that it can be seen as an advanced shoot 'em up rather than a pukka flight simulator. Acquiring a lock on enemy planes and tanks is made easier by the advanced targeting technology of the planes, and escaping enemy fire is aided by the vectored thrust system. Shooting out the tanks clears ground space to set up your own bases, which must then be defended. VTOL (vertical take-off and landing) is correctly implemented, although more traditional horizontal take-offs should be used when space permits. The full range of weapons are provided; experience will tell you which to use in which situations, based on enemy volume and range.</desc>

		<path>./Stun Runner (Europe).zip</path>
		<name>S.T.U.N. Runner</name>
		<desc>Based on the 1989 Atari Games (not to be confused with Atari Corporation, producers of the Lynx) coin-op by Ed Rotberg. It's 2492 and you must pilot your Sub-Terranean Underground Network (S.T.U.N.) craft at speeds over 900 miles per hour through a series of courses to retain your title as S.T.U.N. Runner, completing each course before time runs out. There are also enemies on each course, such as cycles, indestructible armored drones, and flying bird-like craft. Shoot or avoid them. If you hit them, you lose one of your shields (your craft has six total) and are slowed down temporarily. The more shields you have at the finish line, the more bonus points you get. Getting hit with no shields does not kill you, however. There are no lives in this game. The only way to lose is to fail to cross the finish line. Along the way you'll encounter Boost Pads that temporarily speed you up to incredible speeds and make you indestructible. By running over enough green stars on each course, you can also earn Shockwaves, which destroy all enemies in your path. Note that there is no accelerator in this game. Your craft always goes full speed, unless you hit something. Then you will slow down, but quickly accelerate back to full speed. Other than that, you cannot slow down and the only way to speed up is to run over a Boost Pad. Your only controls are steering left and right and aiming the gun on top of your craft up and down.</desc>

There he was robbed his jewels by a group of thieves, and his brave bodyguard entered the maze to recover them, only to be murdered by the thieves on his way back. In present day, the player is an adventurer who accepts the mission to explore the maze and recover the jewels. The maze is shown in a 1st person view, and the player has to navigate it in order to find the jewels and take them outside. Apart from getting lost and exhaustion, other dangers await him, specially in the shape the ghost of the Sultan's bodyguard, who still haunts the place.

You play a witch (although the character looks decidedly masculine, for no apparent reason), and have to negotiate four worlds, each split into bite-size chunks. The levels are populated with bats, trolls and snakes, which have programmed attack patterns and follow you off the screen. You can collect and cast up to 12 spells, which are accessed using the cursor or function keys (the manual amusingly refers to Amigas having F11 and F12 keys, which they don't). These include upgraded weapons (the default one isn't especially powerful), and help such as magic staircases and a metal melter. Some sections of water kill you, other identical ones take you to different sections.</desc>

You are racing against the clock, although there are lots of other bikes on track to avoid and ride around. There are 3 skill levels, which affect the amount of time you have to complete the level, and the bonus offered if you manage to (the amount of time left, divided by a set number, bigger on lower levels). Your bike has 3 gears and appears to have a top speed of around 120 MPH. After every 2 races there's a bonus round in which you must pick up as many tokens as possible in the time limit.</desc>

		<desc>This is a conversion of Sega's popular motorcycle racing arcade game. In this game you race a motorcycle around the world, completing each section of track within a time limit. There are other bikes on the road, but beating this is not important, so they can be thought of as moving obstacles. Each continent is a different difficulty level: Africa is beginner, Asia is junior, the Americas are senior, and Europe is expert. This is a very simple and straightforward game, viewed from behind the bike in 2D (so the screen does not tilt with the bike). The right/left controls are steering, and up/down are gear changes. Your cycle is always moving, and your speed strictly depends on the gear you are in, although contact or running off the road slows the bike down.</desc>

As well as the famous Monaco course, others from around the world have been added, to give the game a longer shelf life. You must complete qualification sessions and the races as fast as possible. The Genesis version of Super Monaco adds a complete career mode, however. In the career mode, your goal is to win a season of races. Unfortunately, you start with a relatively slow car. By challenging other drivers, you can move to a better team and car, and ultimately win the F1 World Title.</desc>

		<desc>The follow-up to Super Pipeline adds new enemies and 16 levels. The player controlled the (white-suited) foreman in charge of keeping the pipeline flowing to fill a number of barrels (which increased on later levels, up to 3). Two types of enemy run onto the pipe - those that can make a hole (commonly drills, a blowtorch and the earthenware jug) and pests (spiders, lobsters and so on). Once a hole is made in the pipe, the foreman must guide a (green-suited) workman to the hole so it can be repaired. While the workman is mending the leak, he is vulnerable to being knocked off the pipe. The foreman is equipped with a gun to shoot enemies, but he can also be knocked off the pipe by the monsters. To make matters more complicated, the lobster can only be attacked from behind (due to its shell) and the "Shower of Tacks" on later levels cannot be shot at all.</desc>

		<desc>Super Scramble Simulator recreates the sport of scrambling/ motorcross, but in a manner similar to the Kikstart TV show and games. The basic aim is to ride a motocross bike through hazardous courses within the time limits. The game uses a split-screen display, with a big window viewed from the side as well as a longer-range aerial view - the latter is useful for dodging hazards to the left or right, as the side-view doesn't demonstrate these accurately. The bike has 3 gears, and you must use a low gear to go uphill. You will need to do wheelies to ensure good landings from the big jumps, and to clear divots in the ground.</desc>

Some tiles react in various ways when you walk on them, like exploding. Unlike Chip's Challenge, the game plays in realtime and you can pick up and use weapons to keep away certain monsters as you paint the tiles. There is also a shop you can enter to purchase items.

		<path>./Super Soccer (Europe).zip</path>
		<name>SuperStar Soccer</name>
		<desc>Much of the design and programming of Superstar Ice Hockey (by many of the same programmers) is revised to provide a six-a-side soccer game. You can control any combination of centre-forward, goalkeeper (on the C64) and manager. For much of the game you are merely the centre-forward as the action unfolds around you - don't be afraid to track back and help out. The ball sticks closely to a player, who can pass, shoot, head or bicycle-kick it. Goalkeepers are penalised for retaining possession for too long (a rule later adapted for use in real-life football). Match length can be between 6 and 90 minutes, by toggling the speed at which time moves. Fouls are fully implemented. Single matches can be played in the cassette version, but the disk version adds a full-season structure. 64 English teams are split into 4 divisions of 16, with a season consisting of either 7 or 15 matches.</desc>

		<desc>A conversion of the arcade game, Super Sprint is a racing game for one or two players. Gameplay is from an overhead view of the racetrack. The racetracks start simple and gradually get more complicated, and may also feature obstacles ranging from traffic cones to tornadoes. Occasionally wrenches will appear in the roadway, and when collected they can be used after a race to power up your car with better tires, better acceleration or a higher top speed.</desc>

		<name>Super Tank Simulator</name>
		<desc>8 challenging zones of battle await you in your role as a tank driver. The game is viewed from above, with rotational control and forward/reverse power for the tank. The routes to travel along are narrow and varied, so some exploration is required  some paths are inevitably safer and faster than others. The walls are particularly useful as they are strong enough to deflect shots, so you can often attack from safe positions round a corner. Opposition includes gun turrets firing at you, enemy tanks and landmines. You start with a standard gun, which must be held down longer to take out tougher foes, but can collect smart bombs and shields. A first-person viewpoint section follows each of these sections, with the sighting under your control, and more helicopters and jeeps to take on.</desc>

First up you must collect the stock to be placed on the shelves, then move it to the appropriate part of the supermarket. Over 30 foods are featured, ranging from bread and milk to eggs and carrots. Each section of the supermarket has its own isometrically-viewed screen. The shoppers are there to get in your way, and other hazards include vandalising kids, un-house-trained dogs and moronic shoppers who don't take their item off the top of the shelves. The ultimate aim of the game is to do so well that you can take over as manager.</desc>

As one of the participants, you need to drive your truck through different tracks in places like London, Brussels or Paris and finish each section in the designated time. Every track features hazards, like ups and downs which limit your visibility, roadworks reducing the road to a single line, and the many other participant trucks. At the end of every track the road forks and the player can choose the next stage in their route. This feature, taken from Sega's "OutRun", makes every trip a new challenge.</desc>

Unfortunately for these species, Survivor (you) wants his race to be the only existing one. With such an evil purpose, you will move in different zones of the spaceship erasing all the species you encounter , including their babies. Your main weapon to do so will be a recalcitrant liquid, which you will be able to throw from your mouth. You are, however not immortal, and in order to recharge you energy you will have to eat some humans.</desc>

You were supposed to sleep - in limited cryogenic suspension - for the next 500 years, 20 miles beneath the surface of the planet, while the great Filtering Computers maintained all surface systems. But the computers have taken you out of suspension because something is terribly wrong: the weather has become brutal, food production is dangerously low, and the Transportation System is malfunctioning, causing unprecedented accidents and casualties. The planet is in chaos. You are physically immobilized. But you have six robots at your disposal, and you must manipulate them strategically to bring the Filtering Computers back into balance. Each robot has a distinct perception of the world and offers you specific abilities - one offers you sight; a second, hearing; a third, access to information in the computer memory banks. Through the robots, you must save the planet from destruction.</desc>

Shape of tiles varies from big and small squares to triangles or hexagons. If tiles have no neighbor tiles you may take appropriate tiles from the pocket of the limited size to eliminate the rest of the tiles. Finishing the level, player will be transferred to the higher level if the results of the current level were high enough for such level. But to finish level successfully, player should acquire the certain number of points and to be qualified for the next level. The difficulty also raises and depends on quantity of colours, the shape of the tiles, and time limit presence. Undo moves are also present, but such moves decrease your final results.

His world is Knutz' Folly, and it comprises almost 200 isometric-viewed screens of danger and challenge, making for a game influenced by Knightlore, although it takes a less serious approach to the genre. Sweevo can enter the world through four different vertical levels, and must use lifts and holes to cross through these to solve many puzzles. You will meet some decidedly weird inhabitants. Most dangerous are the Dictators and Minxes - contact with these will drain Sweevo's energy, as will contact with water (he's a robot, remember). Energy can be recharged by scaring the Geese and picking up the tokens this reveals. The main score is a percentage, although several other totals are kept - most unusually 'Brownie Points', through contact with the brownies.</desc>

One player controlled a helicopter and the other a jeep, with the jeep transforming into a boat when the vehicles passed over water. As well as a host of blaster fodder the game also included a mid-level enemy inspired by the "Goose" enemy from the earlier title Silkworm. Pieces of this enemy would fly onto the screen and assemble into one vehicle before commencing to fire at the players' vehicles. When destroyed the "goose" would drop power-ups.</desc>

		<name>Swords &amp; Sorcery</name>
		<desc>The catacombs of Zob are believed to contain untold wealth and fortune, and this is enough to tempt you. That means entering an imposing dungeon filled with strange foes - Mages, Servants of Set, Revenent Guardians and many more. After taking 14 days of training to build up your skills, or taking the default combinations, your magic and swordplay must face the challenge. Swords and Sorcery is a dungeon-crawler that uses the proprietary MIDAS system to present a first-person visual representation of your position, in a manner similar to Bard's Tale. This is on the left of the screen, with a map of your surroundings on the right, and text messages detailing your current situation below. Below even that are the menus, which are activated by moving a highlight bar left and right before selecting the correct option. Enemies you meet can be threatened, bribed or grovelled to. You can activate any spells you collect, including un-poison, weaken enemy, and freeze enemy. Watch out for magical barriers and traps, and use the transporters to your advantage. When you encounter magic would will have to test it to determine its use or detriment. The Armour of Zob is split into several pieces, which would will hopefully find on your quest. There are also extra swords and shields to collect, plus some treasure as a reward.</desc>

		<desc>You wish to make your fortune in China, in this adaptation of James Clavell's book. First job is to get enough of a loan to buy a ship; once you have this, and get a crew either by paying them or simply kidnapping them, you can begin trading. The game has 3 main stages, and a number of different gameplay elements, largely allowing you choose your own path. Initially you walk the streets trying to get the right elements and people, then you head out onto the waters to head to other trading cities. Upon approaching other ships you can board them and do battle with their inhabitants.</desc>

		<desc>Tapper is an action game where you're a beer tapper (barman) and have to serve beer to demanding customers. There are four customers, each has its own lane lengthier than the previous one, whom you have to keep at bay. If they reach the end of the lane without receiving their beer, you're a goner; if you miss one and accidentally spill beer needlessly you lose a life and should one of them throw you back the mug and you fail to catch it, you lose a life as well. Occasionally a bizarre icon will appear on one of the lines and, should you grab it, will invoke a &amp;quot;cabarette&amp;quot;-style show which will keep some of the customers occupied. The Xbox 360 version includes bonus rounds, as well as co-op and versus multiplayer modes, also online, along with achievements.</desc>

		<desc>Target Plus requires that you have the Gun Stick accessory. It means that your success will depend on whether you have a good shot or not. Game options will be selected with a shot as well. This game consists of two parts which can be played independently, all of being related to aim shooting. The second part does include a 1 or 2 players mode. In the first part you will have to shot at plates flying in the air, accounting for a total of 12, if you hit at least 6 the you will pass to the next round of this first part. You have 3 shots for every two plates, so you have to be effective on a regular basis. Once you have passed this round, you will have to aim at a total of 7 targets, your goal is to hit at least 3 of them, here you only have one shot available for each objective. If you are lucky enough, the stage will be restarted with increased difficulty. In the second part of the game your objective will be to protect a juicy cooked chicken to be mercilessly attacked by spiders or voracious wasps that emerge from everywhere. Your mission would be to shot at them before they can absorb its substance till just leaving the bones. But it will not be easy, as time goes on insects will be more numerous, so if you find it pertinent, you can request the help from a second player. Do not let them spoil your dish...</desc>

		<name>Tarzan</name>
		<desc>According to African legend, a human baby was abandoned in the forest. Found and brought up by a she-ape named Kala, he grew to learn the ways of the jungle and the language of the beasts. Years later, as John Clayton, Lord of Greystoke, he was brought back to England to claim his rightful inheritance. However, he occasionally returns to the wild to become Tarzan, Lord of the Jungle. Now is one of those occasions. Tarzan has returned to the jungle with his wife, Lady Jane Greystoke, but their holiday came to an end when Usanga, evil chief of the Wamabo, kidnaps Jane to force Tarzan into retrieving the seven gemstones that were stolen from his tribal shrine. These gemstones are believed to be the Eyes of the Rainbow, representing each color of the spectrum. Tarzan has been given three days to find the gemstones, otherwise Jane will be eaten by the tribal pet, Sheeta the Panther. After consulting his information sources, Tarzan learns that the Eyes of the Rainbow have been scattered around the dense jungle by a family of pesky chimps. Tarzan's quest involves navigating dark caves, crevasses, swamps, and treacherous quicksand. Objects, such as the rope and torch, need to be found if Tarzan wants to find each gemstone. Throughout the quest, hazards such asheadhunters, lions, snakes, spiders, quicksands, and pits are encountered. If Tarzan comes into contact with any of these hazards, he becomes stunned for an hour and the on-screen timer shrinks accordingly. Fortunately, he can punch creatures, allowing him to escape them. If Tarzan manages to find all seven gemstones within the time limit and deliver them to Usanga, Jane will be released. If not, she will become nothing more than another bowl of jungle soup.</desc>

Each room is littered with moving sprites as well as lava pits and dangerous drops, all of which will drain the energy from Ted's single life. Ted has 21 tasks to complete in this 8 1/2 hour-day, but it is largely up to him to find out what they are, and which order to do them in. The full day includes trips to the canteen, photocopier, power generator and the boss' office - logic will give you clues as to when these are to be accomplished. He knows that solving one problem can change the nature of another, due to the program's advanced Event Processing. In each room, two flashing boxes must be hit, sometimes within a time limit, and Ted knows the location of the first few of these. On the technical side the game promises a full uninterrupted soundtrack and super-smooth animation.</desc>

		<desc>With April O'Neil held hostage by The Shredder's thugs, Bebop and Rocksteady, once again, it's up to the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles to come to her rescue! Play as all four of the turtle heroes, rescue April, and then rescue your sensei Splinter from Mecha-Turtles clutches than go after The Shredder deep in the bowels of The Technodrome itself. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is an action game based on the late eighties/early nineties cartoon series of the same name. Play as Leonardo, Michaelangelo, Donatello and Raphael (one turtle only, but the ability to swap between turtles at any time) as you save your friends and battle The Shredder and his cronies. There are no 'lives', as such - when you lose a turtle, he becomes 'captured', and you cannot use him again until you rescue him from a place hidden in the overworld. Gameplay takes place in two perspectives: a top-down view, which lets you run around and explore buildings, sewers and other places. When entering places from the top-down view, the perspective shifts to a side-scrolling view, where most of the battling takes place. In addition to each turtle's main weapon, sub-weapons (such as shuriken) can be acquired, to use at foes - these have a limited use.</desc>

		<desc>99 Hyperspatial Wireways have long been crucial to man's ability to travel quickly through space. Thus, when aliens invade them, it becomes necessary to fly into and clear them. Tempest is a shooter using wire-frame graphics. Each Wireway is taken on in turn, and has a network of lines guiding the movement paths of both yourself and the aliens. You remain on the outside and keep shooting as the aliens move towards you. Any that reach the outside are fatal to touch, thus limiting your range of movement greatly if 2 or more achieve this. Some aliens move sideways - in dealing with these, plan ahead allowing for the time your shots to take to travel. You have a Super Zapper, which can be used once on each level to wipe out all aliens currently active, but this scores no points.</desc>

		<name>Tenpin Challenge</name>
		<desc>Tenpin Challenge was a budget choice for ten-pin bowling enthusiasts to play the game at home. Up to four players can take part, with a choice of five ball weights. The computer does the scoring automatically, taking bonus points for strikes and spares into account. Your high scores can be saved to cassette. Taking a shot has three stages. First you must aim the shot by moving a cursor left and right. then, you must set the spin, by stopping a spinning diagram as it quickly moves through the 360 degrees. Finally you set the pace, by holding down the 'a' key for the right length of time, with no power gauge to guide you. Once this is done you will see the shot outcome, with a split screen showing the ball moving sideways at first, and then towards (and hopefully into) the bunch of pins, which are then moved and replaced as necessary.</desc>

There are over 100 screens to fly through, and they include many barriers and narrow paths, as well as force fields. There are also time-shift fields - some move you forward, but some send you back to the start. Enemies are in short supply - the game's feel resembles Artificial Dreams (from the same designer). You have limited fuel and must collect fuel tokens to recharge this. Other available powerups include points bonuses, extra lives, changes to the constant speed of scrolling, and invincibility from force fields (although not enemies).</desc>

Avoid the bulls and sharks, take care to avoid heatstroke, and make sure your family doesn't run off. Getting there and simply surviving all the hazards the brochure 'forgot' to mention is a challenge in itself, but you must also take 10 holiday snaps to prove what you got up to. The game is structured similarly to a real holiday. There are day trips to go on, which provide extra photo opportunities. A few Spanish phrases such as 'QUE QUIRE USTED' ('what do you want?') and 'UNA HABITACION' ('a room') are included; the manual details these. The parser is primarily VERB NOUN.</desc>

		<desc>Just because a region is bleak, desolate and inhospitable doesn't mean it lacks value. The planet Colian is a case in point; it has plentiful stocks of tough metal Aluma, the explosive Detonite, and the energy giving Quaza crystals. The units which are mining them are under the control of the Empire, and are forced to produce destructive Terrorpod units. The rival Federation attempts to shut this operation down, and sends you to the surface in a Defence Strategy Vehicle. Your task is to find each of the six bases before the Empire can destroy evidence of them. Destroy all the Terrorpods in order to reach the bases. The action is viewed from your DSV, as you move and shoot at any encroaching Terrorpods. Colian has a heavy inertia field, so you are always moving. You have guided missiles at your disposal, although these use up some of your limited Detonite stocks. Missiles will also be aimed at you; avoid these. As all this action unfolds, you are trying to ensure that enough components can be produced in the mines, and can be retrieved in order to go towards the Federation's own building efforts. Collect the resultant products to attach them to your DSV.</desc>

		<desc>The original commercially-licensed version of Alexey Pajitnov's classic Tetris puzzle game. Geometric shapes fall from the top of a playfield to rest on the bottom; fit the pieces together, and the line they form disappears. If the pieces don't form lines and eventually stack up to the top of the playfield, the game is over. Difficulty increases by dropping the pieces faster and faster over time. Tetris is a verifiable classic game, translated to well over 200 electronic and computer platforms. It takes 2 minutes to learn, but a lifetime to master.</desc>

Different joystick combinations let your fighter perform high, middle or low attacking moves as well as dodge or block his opponent's attacks. Fighters receive scores for successful attacks. The more difficult or effective the attack, the higher the score. Unless one fighter is knocked out, the fighter who has the highest score at the end of three rounds wins. Although the game is shown from an isometric perspective, it is not possible to move in three dimensions.</desc>

		<desc>This game covers the first 30 days of what was then feared to be the next war in Europe. You can choose to be the supreme commander of the NATO or the Warsaw Pact. In your control are air and ground units. These are backed up by your ability to make strategic nuclear/chemical attacks. As the Warsaw Pact commander your task is to break the lines of the NATO alliance, which you see is a powerful invasion force, poised on your border. Your first task is to take over West Germany. As NATO commander your task is to stop the Russian invasion. Hold the lines on West Germany's border. You will achieve this by preventing the occupation of West Germany. Your computer opponent can play in three different ways. Nuclear weapons can be disabled for a Beginner game, while the thought processes can be either rational or unpredictable. Gameplay is turn-based and primarily strategic, but some scenes can be played out in optional action sequences.</desc>

To do this you will have to hire a team of criminals, with skills ranging from explosives to driving - these will each seek an upfront payment and a percentage cut of the eventual profits. You will have to buy information and plans on potential targets - an art gallery and bank for example. Menu options reveal pop-up windows of information and sub-menus. Planning the raid itself is your next task. An overhead view of the site is prevented, with your information on doors and storage locations all readily available. You move each member around the map to give them orders, using a displayed clock to ensure that the action timings overlap correctly. Many options bring up sub-menus of icons. During the actual crime, you wait outside, with a walkie-talkie to issue orders. Keep an eye out for police cars, as their presence may for you to freeze, or run off with what you have so far. You can enter the site to help out, but this leaves you defenceless if the police arrive.</desc>

Thing bounces to the rescue, and resolves to retrieve them from his 4 storey underground lair. To do this he must collect 9 pieces of a jigsaw puzzle on each floor. Needless to say, Goblin has not made things easy - a myriad of traps await our intrepid hero. There are traps all over, some crucial areas are guarded by switches, and the last of these switches locks the level-ending lift. Thing on a Spring is a platform game, made unusual by Thing's motion method. He can bounce to reach great heights, and be bounced off platforms strategically to reach higher platforms. You have limited oil, which is lost through contact with the many nasties you will encounter.</desc>

Herbert and Wilma Week are trapped by them, so Wally has become the third Week in paradise in his attempt at rescuing them. This is an arcade adventure resembling the other Wally Week games, although it represents David Perry's design debut. There are many animals to avoid including stinging bees and butterflies, but the toughest foe is the Indian chief, best avoided with a well-timed jump. There are multi-stage puzzles to solve on each screen, and a limit of carrying 2 objects at a time. The setting is largely jungle, but there are forests, beaches and huts amongst other things to explore as well. Movement between screens is generally from left to right, but you will go into the screen via signposted sections, and occasionally travel vertically as well.</desc>

		<name>Throne of Fire</name>
		<desc>This was Consult Computer Systems first major collaboration with Mike Singleton. It is a slash 'em up 1 or 2 player game in which you play one of 3 princes, each out to defeat his brothers and gain control of the castle. You can see the 2 players simultaneously side by side. You navigate to the different rooms by selecting the windows on the scrolling castle display on the bottom of the screen. These windows are colour coded to whichever prince controls that particular room. The rooms are displayed as a view from the window showing exits left, right and forward (which can move you up or down). There is a neat animation when a player dies showing blood dribbling down the screen.</desc>

		<name>Through the Trap Door</name>
		<desc>In his previous adventure, Berk had to complete tasks that were given by his master, the Bad Tempered Thing, and had to deal with his creatures that lurk from underneath the Trap Door. Now one day, Berk, along with his friend Drutt, decided to explore his domain by going through the Trap Door. You take control of both Drutt and Berk, swapping between them with the fire button. They need to solve a series of puzzles and deal with new creatures along the way. There are four regions to explore, and opening locked doors give access to later regions. Scattered throughout the regions are sweets and toadstools which, when consumed, will provide Berk with special characteristics. Progress is made by using the two characters together, as Drutt can reach places that Berk cannot.</desc>

		<name>Thrust</name>
		<desc>Thrust took a unique game style by bringing realistic physics and inertia-based movement into arcade games, directly influencing titles like Oids, not to mention the same author's Exile from Audiogenic. The action is viewed from the side, with the graphics drawn in vectors, in keeping with the mathematical nature of everything that unfolds. As a Resistance fighter, the player must fly into enemy lines in order to steal Klystron Pods to power more advanced starships, using your tractor beam to take them. A network of mounted guns are aiming to shoot the player down  these can be disabled by shooting their power source, but eventually this will explode, forcing the player to flee. Some of the later levels feature reverse gravity, which is where things really get difficult.</desc>

You may turn left/right at the angle of 45 degrees, move at the angle of 45 degrees, accelerate/decelerate speed of your moving, shoot, and metamorphose into a spacejet at will. During 12 levels of gameplay enemies fly towards you, and you should shoot them or avoid them, because each meeting with the enemy means decreasing the number of instances of your transformer. You'll also need to collect spheres to maintain your fuel levels. When all instances of your spacejet will be lost you may be enlisted in the High Score Table.</desc>

Each of these involves a two-man squad, whom you can switch between at any time. Each must select the correct objects to bring beforehand. You will have to move through the screens via lifts and ladders, avoid hazards and solve puzzles. Mission one is set in a mine shaft, which is rapidly flooding and has two miners trapped. Next up is a nuclear submarine stranded after hitting a mine, which must be repaired and reactivated before it explodes. During this mission, you discover evidence of the miner's construction, so must break into a bank to steal the appropriate documents. This reveals that a madman is holding International Rescue to ransom, so you must finally travel to his lair to stop him.</desc>

Although you start with only a sword, more can be collected by attacking the various containers through the levels - later weapons can destroy these enemies quicker, and allow attacks from a distance. Reaching the end of each level sees bonuses for time and kills. The path through the game can be varied on later levels, so you can play it through more than once and find new sections, even though the individual levels only scroll left-to-right.</desc>

Standard shots plus topspin, lobs and stop volleys are available, by pushing the joystick in the right direction as you aim the shot. The game supports up to 16 players in singles matches on a variety of court surfaces. It includes all of the major world tournaments - the four Grand Slam events at Melbourne, Roland Garros, Wimbledon and New York, plus the Davis Cup and Masters events. An early attempt at TV-style coverage is offered.</desc>

		<desc>Dark forces have set out to destroy the fabric of time, by opening eight space-time continuum portals. Each one is guarded by a great mind, who must have a relevant object returned to them before they will allow you to seal the portals. Doing this requires formulating a spell from the runes the Minds give you. All of this is played out in a combination of side-view action and icon-based object manipulation. Starting in your living room as you search for a weapon and its bullets, you move along a network of levels and ladders, avoiding or shooting the many foes you encounter. Pressing down and fire together brings up a menu allowing you to pick up items, swap them with Guardians, and cast spells (with the chance to test them first).</desc>

		<name>Tir Na Nog</name>
		<desc>The first of a trilogy of similarly-designed titles from Gargoyle Games, Tir Na Nog is a complex mix of arcade and adventure elements done in an innovative way. The game is viewed from the side, and to change direction you must rotate the view. You play Cuchulainn, and you must restore the Sidhe race to its former position of intelligence, enlightenment and civilization. This can be done by retrieving the four pieces of the Seal of Calum, which was shattered when the Great Enemy invaded. Many puzzles are presented in the form of cryptic text messages (displayed in a neat pseudo-Celtic font), ranging form 'find my crown for a gift' to 'The backdoor key is me' - lateral thinking is required to interpret these messages. The action side of things is challenging, especially before you have found a good sword or mace. When you die, you return to the start of the game, but the settings of objects are left exactly as they were - making it important to regularly save the game, as it's possible to lose weaponry in a situation so precarious that you have little chance of retrieving it without suffering more combat.</desc>

		<name>Titan</name>
		<desc>Titan is a 2D arcade game / puzzle game hybrid. For some reason, mad professors of the future tend to invent strange entertainment games in which every participant dies. Professor Hybrys variant is called Titan and involves a ball, a control unit and 80 labyrinths. Your objective is either to destroy all destructible blocks in each level by hitting them with the sphere, or to pilot it to the exit. The black ball is beyond your control; it will bounce straight or diagonally through the labyrinth with constant speed. You move the control unit, a small box, with you are to position in a way that the ball bounces off it in the desired direction. You can also catch the sphere by quickly moving over it, and then release it in a direction of your choice. The labyrinths not only contain harmless, destructible blocks, but also increasingly difficult hazards. If the sphere or your control unit hit a skull symbol, one of your nine lives is lost. Teleporters exchange the position of you and the ball, wall pieces can be pushed around or destroyed by your unit, floor tiles will grow into walls when you pass over them too often. The high game speed can be slowed down by holding the space key  a very useful option in tricky situations. Titan mixes an arcade game foundation (requiring quick reflexes and good nerves) with puzzle game elements (requiring logical thinking to beat the complex levels). The challenge is to control the sphere accurately, yet indirectly.</desc>

		<name>Titanic Blinky</name>
		<desc>Arthur J. Hackensack, an insane Texas billionaire bent on conquering the world, kidnaps professor Frobisher Goonhilly, a paranormal scientist working on a matter transformation weapon. As a demonstration of its powers, Arthur transforms the Isle of White into a giant custard slice, New York into a bath sponge and the Eiffel Tower into a toast rack. The ghost Blinky, secret agent for S.P.E.C.T.R.E. (Society for the Prevention of Ectoplasmic Crime, Telekinetic misuse and Reality Endangerment), infiltrates the madman's sea ship (the newly raised SS Titanic) armed with an ectoplasmic gun and a case full of disguises. Titanic Blinky is a platform adventure and a clone of Dizzy, replacing the egg protagonist with a slightly effeminate ghost. As in that game, the aim is to collect objects (by pulling down on the movement controls) to solve puzzles. One main difference from Dizzy is the fact that Blinky carries a gun with infinite ammunition. There's an energy bar at the bottom of the screen that gets depleted every time Blinky touches an enemy. When it's empty, Blinky literally flips over and the player loses one life. The game starts with three lives, and there's no form of saving progress.</desc>

		<name>Tobruk: The Clash of Armour</name>
		<desc>The battle for Tobruk in May-July 1942 was one of the key battles of the North African front in World War 2. Rommel lead the Axis forces to a victory, taking out Allied forces which were gathered to densely mine a strategic defensive area of Libya. In this tactical wargame, players can do the same. Taking the six Allied supply points is crucial to your mission's success. You must guide the movement and attacks of your units. You can also call in aircraft and engineer support. The game is turn-based; once you have given your orders, the Allies do the same. Unit damage is progressively calculated. Unlike the Allies, you use mobile suppliers, which you also command. They should be kept in range of your units (with no Allied forces in between). The game includes optional action sequences, which can be practised outside the main game. You control navigation, driving and gunning (with turrets and machine guns) for individual units, from a first-person view. The Amstrad version has an additional mode - by linking 2 CPCs via a special lead, a simultaneous two-player strategy-only game is set up, in which one player represents the Allies.</desc>

And then, there appears the usual crazy scientist, in this case called Dr Acid, who kidnaps the hero's girlfriend with the intention to provide diversion to his diabolic creations. The small and roundish friend cannot allow this, so he goes quickly to her rescue. In order to accomplish it, he will have to face four different levels in which all kind of tiny beasts will try to cut his way. Thus, on the first stage, the disco, he will have to avoid some crude dudes, siphons, drinks which fall from above, etc., whereas he desperately looks for the eight plates that will allow the access to the next levels, which are: the beach, the pirate ship, and finally, the Acid House.</desc>

		<desc>Flight simulation specialists Digital Integration turned their attention to helicopter flight in this recreation of the AH-64 Apache. All the controls are realistically simulated, so the airspeed is dependent on the height of the vehicle, and you can move horizontally using the rudder option as well as rolling left and right. If using a Sinclair joystick interface you can use both ports to have all these controls accessible on dual joysticks, just like the real thing. Either way, a full instrument panel allows monitoring of these. You are armed with cannons, rockets and anti-tank missiles, each of which has its target set up independently, but only one can be loaded at once. Flight options include day/night, clear/cloudy and air turbulence on/off, allowing beginners and experts to find a suitable setting. Scenery includes trees, mountains and pylons, while enemy targets include helicopters, turrets and tanks.</desc>

You are armed with missiles (while put you in control of a small target zone, which must reman over your opponent for 3 seconds), flares and cannons (which overheat when overused)- use these more wisely than your opponent. Pay attention to speed and altitude too. The computer has 3 planes to throw at you, of which the last is the toughest, while each player in a 2-player game also has 3 'lives'.</desc>

In order to do this, Quaid must go through level after level of beating up bad guys that get in his way. Some of the levels differ in gameplay, and range between action and driving scenes. The action scenes mainly require you to collect some items before leaving the level. You have only one chance to complete the current level, which means that if your energy is lost, the game ends. Energy is lost if you are attacked by an obstacle, or if you are shot at by an enemy. You can gain more energy by either collecting some pills or a heart, depending on the platform.</desc>

		<name>Toyota Celica GT Rally</name>
		<desc>A detailed recreation of rallying licensed from Toyota Great Britain. Driving on gravel, asphalt and ice is involved, with each race made up of a series of short stages to complete. After each stage, your times are compared with those of your rivals, whose names are subtly changed from the real drivers of the day. Up to four human players can be involved, taking it in turns. As visibility is sometimes low, and the exact curvature of a corner isn't always obvious from the apex, a co-driver is provided to give pace notes. These can be adjusted before you take to the track, specifying what is defined as 'hard left' and how early the warning should be given. The steering sensitivity can be adjusted, and you can choose between automatic centering, and a push-the-opposite-way-to-centre mode, but more unusual is the option to race with the steering directions reversed - definitely one for advanced players.</desc>

		<name>Tracksuit Manager</name>
		<desc>Tracksuit Manager varied the conventional Football Manager game style in a number of ways. You take charge of an international team aiming to qualify for and then play in the European Championships and World Cup. This means there is no transfer market, just a pool of 100 eligible players from which a squad of 22 is selected. You can view reports on each player's ability and form at any stage of the squad and team selection process. You can arrange friendly matches to try out players and ensure that the squad plays together as much as possible. The matches are presented as a running commentary, with a small graphic indicating which area of the pitch the ball is in. A wide range of tactical options are available to dictate the team's passing style, defensive approach and so on, and in another first you can give specific instructions to individual players (maybe telling a particularly pacy defender to man-mark a dangerous opposition winger instead of staying in a set position).</desc>

		<desc>Traffic is a simple game where the player has to guide cars, motorbikes and buses through busy London streets by changing the traffic lights from red to green. The objective in order to advance to the next level is to get a preset number of vehicles through the screen, although it does not matter which exit you direct them through. Cars continue to queue off the edges of the screen (with numbers next to them if there are queued cars beyond your vision) and if the queue reach more than five cars, it's game over. A warning sound is given when five cars are queued; you must hope there are not also queues on surrounding roads. Cars always stay on their side of the road, and collisions are not possible.</desc>

		<path>./Trailblazer (Europe).zip</path>
		<name>Trailblazer</name>
		<desc>An imaginative action game in which you must guide a ball-shaped craft through a succession of levels. These have a patchwork-quilt type display, with holes to avoid, and squares of various colors, which affect the craft's speed, both within its power potential and into warp, as well as a control-reverser and lots of holes. You can jump these holes by pressing fire, although you have a limited number of these for each level, and adjust the speed by pulling the joystick forward or backwards. You face a time limit on each of the 21 levels, although your time is boosted every time you complete one. A simultaneous 2-player mode is included, similar to the split-screen mode in the Lotus games (by the same authors).</desc>

		<name>Trashman</name>
		<desc>While few young people aspire to the role of a Dustman, New Generation Software felt they would enjoy pretending to be one on this innovative arcade game. Each section presents you with a road of houses, drawn from forced-perspective 3D, with flick-scrolling as you move up the road. Each house's dustbin must be collected, emptied and replaced within the time limit, which is indicated by the Bonus timer at the top of the screen. If this reaches zero, you receive the first of 3 warnings - a third sees you out of a job. Setting foot on the grass causes the onus to drop more quickly, and there are additional hazards to avoid, including the local cars, which appear to be driven by maniacs, and cyclists and barking dogs, which can both injure you and cause your movement to slow.</desc>

But of course, as in every other story where some bad guys take a place which doesn't belong to them, there will appear a guy ready to end with them. Trigger is a game with a 1st person perspective where you have to make use of your Gun Stick accessory. The game has a side scroll by which you will see a multitude of enemies emerging. Some of them will shot at you, others will launch grenades, knives... there will even be exhibitionists. But don't go too fast, there will be other persons to which you should not shot at, otherwise points would be reduced from your marker. Also, there will also appear some objects that will recharge your ammunition.</desc>

		<desc>Life has never been too quiet in Marrakesh, but lately things have been getting harder. Ait-Amar, the daughter of the sultan, has been kidnapped by a group of Berbers and they are forcing him to give half of his fortune within three days. But as you know, with every kidnapping of a princess there's always an hero ready to rescue her, and Ben-Yussef, our protagonist, has been the chosen one this time to get into the labyrinthine and dangerous Kasbah in order to affront the kidnappers and rescue the handsome daughter of the Sultan. As expected, it will be a hard task, because although there are some local residents willing to give clues in exchange for some coins, others will try to steal everything they can. Besides these two types of Moors, deep in the Kasbah there are women to which you can steal their money, policemen that will take your weapons, and thugs who are at the doors of the houses that you must enter in order to find the princess. Like any human being, Ben-Yussef must replenish his strength in inns and restaurants and rest in hotels or hostels, implying a significant economic outlay. You can also buy new weapons in the armouries prepared to this effect, bearing in mind that depending on the neighborhood, these elements may also vary in price.</desc>

		<name>Turbo Boat Simulator</name>
		<desc>You are aboard a powerful boat, deep in enemy territory, and must get through this to make it back in one piece. To help you do this, allied planes drop pieces of the map onto the water, all of which must be collected to complete the level. Gameplay is side-scrolling, and the boat can be steered up and down the screen as well as accelerated in either direction. The waterways have many mounds and blockades in place, as in Spy Hunter. Enemy boats and planes shoot at you, and also drop mines.</desc>

		<name>Turbo Cup</name>
		<desc>Based on sportscar and Paris-Dakar racer René Metge and his Porsche 944 Turbo, Turbo Cup is a racing game viewed from above and behind the car, in a forced perspective. Instead of the sand of the Dakar race, the game features four conventional French racetracks - Paul Ricard, Nogaro, Magny-Cours and Dijon-Prenois. After completing a qualifying lap you race against 21 similar cars. Contact with cars from behind causes you to spin but does not affect your rival, although side-on contact is usually beneficial. There are hazards off the track to avoid, and hitting the grass at speed causes a spin.</desc>

		<name>Turbo Esprit</name>
		<desc>Turbo Esprit puts you in control of a Lotus Esprit cop car, with the challenge of breaking up a drugs gang and protecting the innocent. A map is built into the car, which can instantly show the positions of the baron's cars - this is crucial because you can't interrupt them before the initial deal is done, as this will simply make them leave and try again another time. The game's environment is large and varied, with traffic lights, junctions and zebra crossings accurately implemented, and pedestrians to avoid. The roads are multi-laned, and at the end of each road you can turn across, which makes the game's perspective shift in a flick-screen manner. One unusual feature for the time is a saveable high-score table.</desc>

There are 16 stages set across the US, gradually moving from east to west, all depicted differently visually. After every 4 levels, you go into a shop screen, with a choice of upgrades.

		<name>Turbo the Tortoise</name>
		<desc>After Doctor Mulliner and his assistant Beckett make a mistake using Cybernetic technology prototypes, Mulliners pet tortoise Wal is given super powers. The only way a working machine can be built is for this tortoise to travel through time and collect the required parts from six time periods (Prehistoric, Ice Age, Egyptian, Mediaeval, 20th Century and the Future). Taking the role of Turbo the Tortoise, the player must travel through six side-scrolling platform levels, each of them well-guarded by enemies. Limited weaponry can be collected, although jumping on the heads of these foes will also kill them. Turbo must allow for moving platforms, switches, fragile platforms and water hazards. Enhancements and extra lives are in hard-to-reach places, often only accessible by using enemy heads as launch pads.</desc>

		<path>./Turrican II - The Final Fight (Europe) (Disk 1).zip</path>
		<name>Turrican II : The Final Fight</name>
		<desc>Turrican II: The Final Fight is a platformer/shooter as typically seen on consoles, but designed for home computers from the ground up. Its plot is - naturally - very simple: an evil mega-robot called The Machine attacks the United Planets Ship Avalon 1, slaughtering all who resist. All - except Bren McGuire, who manages to escape and slips into the experimental Turrican bionic armor. As Turrican, he strives to show The Machine who's the boss. Unlike other games of its type, this game contains three levels of horizontal shooter action in the spirit of R-Type or the developers' own Katakis. Six large worlds are to be explored, where you are basically free to go everywhere you want, since there is no automatic scrolling and the levels are packed with hidden extra lives and weapons. All those levels are very different: the first one in the rock desert is pretty colorful with parallaxing rainbow background and happy music, while the following worlds get darker and darker. Turrican can get some different weapons for his arm cannon: 1. The bounce weapon which rebounds from surfaces into smaller bouncing balls when powered up; The laser, which can shoots beams as large as Turrican himself when maxed out; the multiple shot beam, which can shoot up to five beams covering approximately a 90 degree angle. The Turrican suit weaponry is not limited to the arm cannon however: 1. He also can fire a continuous beam, activated by holding the fire button. This beam can be rotated around Turrican, so it is possible to blast things below him in this way; Additionally, he can fire power lines by pressing the space bar, resulting in two energy bars as high as the screen going from the Turrican suit to the left and right of the screen, severely damaging enemies in the process; If the space bar is pressed when the hero is crouching, the Turrican will morph into a shuriken shape. In this state, it will roll to the left or the right, damaging enemies while being invincible and small bombs can be dropped by pressing the fire button; Finally, the most powerful attack, which can only be used one time per life, can be delivered by pressing the fire button and the space bar at the same time. The Turrican suit will morph into a shuriken shape and fly around the screen for several seconds, while firing shots of the different weapons in multiple directions.</desc>

		<desc>Finding the mysterious Elephant's Graveyard in Africa was your Father's lifelong quest. When he disappears you are determined to find out what might have happened to him, and what secrets may lie within. This side scrolling arcade adventure is split into three stages, taking in the harsh and barren desert, an underground network of caves, and a tough tribal jungle. The natives are hostile to your presence, and weaponry must be found to fend them off, although its use does little to put the natives at ease initially. The machete to cut through the jungle is equally important. At many other points you will need to use objects you have found along the way. The backgrounds are in full 3D and can serve to obscure the character when he is behind trees or rocks.</desc>

		<desc>Uchi Mata is a unique tournament-based Judo fighting game in which you play as a judoka in the ultimate tournament. The game is played from a non-scrolling side view. You control your fighter and attempt to get within striking distance of your opponent, however you don't attack directly with your attack button. Instead, your attack command puts you in a fighting stance that allows you to input a series of directional moves. That, combined with the correct feet placement of both fighters (which can be seen in a helpful window) allows you to unleash specific throws and offensive maneuvers that form the basis of the combat in the game. A stamina and health bar also keep your attacks in check, as you may need to rest and build up your strength in order to perform effective attacks.</desc>

Ulysses, the Greek hero, recently washed away on the beach after a storm destroyed his ship and its crew, is summoned by the populace to rescue the kidnapped women. In exchange, they promise to help him return to Itaca, his home. To aid in his quest, he receives from a wise elder a magical hammer. Ulises is a side-scrolling platform game from Spain. Although Spanish, the game has almost no text, only four words: "Opera Soft", the name of the company; "Ulises", the spanish name of the character, and the word "Fin" at the end (spanish for "The End"). The Ulysses character moves from left to right throwing hammers to kill an incessant wave of enemies. The game doesn't have levels, but sections within one expansive level. Precise jumps are required to clear abysses and gorges, and to avoid collision with dangerous objects. The SPACE bar makes the character throw the hammer forward. O and P move Ulysses left or right, respectively. Q is the jump/move up button, and A is the crouch/move down button. The game starts with three lives, and each rescued damsel adds an extra one. There isn't any form of saving progress.</desc>

		<name>U.N. Squadron</name>
		<desc>Side-scrolling shoot-em-up, in a similar style to such games as Gradius, R-Type and Scramble. The aim is to wipe out the enemy, which has gathered around the allied airspace of 'Area 88', in a series of military aircraft-based scenarios. You choose one of three unique pilots; Shin Kazama, Micky Schymon or Greg Gates, each with varying abilities at damage repair, weapon handling and flying skill, and engage the enemy over a series of challenging missions. The player starts out with the weakest plane, the F8E Crusader, which can only be armed with a very basic range weapons. But, through completing various missions, enough cash can be raised to purchase higher-quality aircraft. These superior planes are more agile, have improved resilience to damage and have a greater range of fire. Furthermore, the more advanced fighters can be armed with superior special weapons, such as napalm. The missions include attacks on sand bases, the nuclear submarine 'Seavet' and enemy supply camps, as well as seeing off groups of airborne 'bandits' who swarm-in on Area 88. The enemy is plentiful, and the pace is frantic. Shoot at everything on the screen that moves, and the allied forces might just come out on top......</desc>

		<desc>Side-scrolling shoot-em-up, in a similar style to such games as Gradius, R-Type and Scramble. The aim is to wipe out the enemy, which has gathered around the allied airspace of 'Area 88', in a series of military aircraft-based scenarios. You choose one of three unique pilots; Shin Kazama, Micky Schymon or Greg Gates, each with varying abilities at damage repair, weapon handling and flying skill, and engage the enemy over a series of challenging missions. The player starts out with the weakest plane, the F8E Crusader, which can only be armed with a very basic range weapons. But, through completing various missions, enough cash can be raised to purchase higher-quality aircraft. These superior planes are more agile, have improved resilience to damage and have a greater range of fire.

		<desc>Your home solar system of 15 planets has been attacked by a horde of Super Dreadnoughts, from a race who wish to harvest your universe's minerals for their own use. You must pilot your craft through some of the hardest levels ever created and shoot down all the enemy space craft and ground weapons, and avoid the many indestructible hazards. The innovation is that you do not simply travel in a single direction, but instead move from left to right or right to left depending on where the current targets are, in a manner more similar to Defender than most shoot 'em ups.</desc>

		<desc>When, at the end, he could gather a good amount of money and exited the Storm Palace, Uwol thought that he had finally succeeded. He began walking his way home, when he was suddenly hit by a Fanty guardian from inside the Palace and fell rolling down a very steep slope, only to end landing in the middle of Phantomas' Electric Garden. Besides, to top it all, during the fall he had lost EVERY coin he had just gathered from inside the Palace. Great. Stupendous. So much work, a full game, four ports to different systems, a lot of good reviews and awards? all for nothing. Uwol, feeling completely downhearted, though that it would be O.K. if he just went accross the Electric Garden and returned home to keep pittying himself. Nevertheless, he soon discovered a bunch of mysterious pipes scattered accross the whole garden, and they looked just like those in the good ol' Super Mario Bros ? he were so much alike that they even leaded to obscure caves full of COINS! Now the decision is yours: Will you just escape the Electric Gardens in the Storm Palace, o will you take your chance to gather as much coins as you can before leaving?</desc>

Only your quick man-management and combat strategy nous can save your presence in the galaxy (made up of 4096 sectors across the 64 quadrants) in this Star Trek-influenced game. At all stages many commands are available to you, which are typed in using 2 letter codes. Instructions include activating the propulsion engines, firing one of your weapons, viewing the scanner to get either a short- or long-range view of the area, or viewing a damage report. Your supply of weaponry is recharged and damage repaired by docking at a Starbase. Time passes as you make your decisions, and attacks on Starbases must be warded off within set time limits.</desc>

		<desc>Your mission here is really obscure. You must destroy the evil Count Dracula who is devastating the region. The scenario of your nightmare will be the Castle of this malevolent personage. Throughout 95 horrifying rooms you will be besieged by his slaves, try to avoid them and obtain the greater amount of food as possible. If you reunite the 5 keys and you introduce them in its 5 corresponding bolts you would have done a very important part of the mission. In order to obtain each key you must find a certain object and fix it in the "generator by pedals", if you do it well you will be able to jump the enormous pit. The second part of your mission consists in opening the 6 magical counter-windows pressing the suitable switches. Finally, search for the hammer and the stake and walk quickly to the superior part of the castle to take the cross. At this moment you will be teleported to the space to get rid of the final confrontation in which you will be able to use the laser weapon and the self-propelled knapsack.</desc>

		<name>Wacky Darts</name>
		<desc>The bar-room game of darts involves aiming small projectiles at a circular board. The board is divided into 20 shapes around the edge, each of which has a value from 1 to 20 points, a special 'double' area around the edge, and a special 'treble' area in the middle (each of which multiply the shot score). There is also a Bullseye right in the middle for 50 points, and an Outer Bull around it, worth 25 points. Players always take three shots at a time. In the 501 game the aim is to reduce your score from 501 to 0, finishing with a double or the bull. If your score reaches 1 or a negative number, any shots in that set of 3 are cancelled out. In Round The Board you must hit each target in turn starting with 20, but moving back 2 or 3 for a double or treble, eventually finishing with Double Top. Both of these games are recreated in this simulation. The movement of the cursor you use to aim is slightly skiddy, to recreate natural jitters (or, as some would cynically suggest, the effects of being as drunk as most darts players). Wacky Darts lives up to its name by featuring an assortment of human, alien and machine opponents of varying difficulties. Each of them has a short profile, and use a different object to hit the board.</desc>

		<name>Wacky Races</name>
		<desc>You take on the role of Dastardly and Mutley from the Hanna-Barbera cartoon series in this action title with superficial racing overtones. Your aim is to complete each course in a particular position, which is achieved either by waiting for them to suffer enough damage to drop out of the race, or by inflicting that damage yourself. Your car is armed with a forward-shooting arrow to impale the opposition cars, and deal with the many hazards the races throw at you, including boulders and rabbits, which can be taken out for points. The action is viewed from the side, scrolling horizontally as you progress, and vertically when you need to jump or duck over the bigger hazards, which must be avoided Moon Patrol style, meaning that you must often time one jump properly so as to be able to make the next one successfully. In some sections of the road you can duck down onto another set of roads, which may or may not be less hazardous. Falling into thin air costs you a life, while heavy impacts deduct some of your energy points. When the view doesnt show the next section, and the correct course is not clear, an arrow appears to direct you.</desc>

		<desc>Only you can save the world from destruction, by finding four parts of the weapon to use against the Alien Syndicate's evil leader. This task must be completed within 80 minutes, although you have five lives available. Gameplay mainly involves propelling your jumpsuit-backed and powerfully-armed character through the levels, destroying the alien forces as he goes. The levels have lots of pieces of ledges and spikes all around, which must be planned around, as well as lava pits. There is extra weaponry and ammunition to collect along the way. Your main weapon can be fired in any direction, but you can't move and fire at the same time unless you're firing to the left or right.</desc>

		<desc>Recreating the famous Le Mans 24 race, although fortunately not in real-time, Konami's coin-op found its way onto the home systems. Although you're racing against the other cars, you must make each checkpoint in the required amount of time in order to complete the game. The lap is split into three sections, so the fourth section is identical to the first, the fifth to the second, and so on. As the game goes on, the bonus time offered for each section drops, so you have to drive better as the game goes on to stay in. Night is represented as well, with everything darkened and the need for headlights. The circuit features barriers and trackside trees, so avoid contact with these, and try not to stray onto the grass as this slows you down.</desc>

		<desc>Welltris, which is the first Tetris sequel, is originally designed by Alexey Pajitnov (the creator of Tetris) with Andrei Sgenov. It has the same gameplay concept as Tetris; simply all the player has to do is to rotate and maneuver the falling pieces into a proper position in order to form complete layers in the rectangular playground. But Welltris changes this rectangular arena into a four sided well with grid-like walls and bottom where the falling pieces can be moved from wall to wall within the well. Form the pieces into solid rows either horizontally or vertically on the bottom of the well. Billed itself as Tetris in three dimensions.</desc>

		<desc>A curse has turned you into a werewolf, which is surely bad news for your employment and relationship prospects. The only way to rid yourself of the curse is to kill all the relatives of those who inflicted it. The more you kill, the more the police want to capture and jail you, but with the right equipment you can get out and continue your murderous rampage. The game is an arcade adventure viewed at an angle. Collect as many objects as you can from people, including Underground tickets to get around London more quickly, torches and manhole cover removers to access and function in dark areas, and bandages to repair shot wounds. These objects can be stored for later use, even inside your jail cell.</desc>

The Beershooting event requires you to shoot a 5 beer glass targets faster than your opponent, but this is not too easy if you get nervous.Player 1 moves the joystick to the right to draw their gun, while Player 2 must move theirs to the left. Once the gun is drawn, the crosshairs are used to line up the target. Press the joystick button to fire. A beating heart shows the degree of your nervousness in the display. Quid-spitting requires that you bite off the right amount of tobacco and chew it to just the right consistency before you determine what angle to spit it into the pot. This requires some fancy joystick handling. To lift your arm and bite off the quid, you must move the joystick forward.To chew, you must move the joystick fast to the left and right. Don't chew it too long or too short. To stop chewing, you must move the joystick forward. Once that is done you must pull the stick back to determine the strength. Click and hold the joystick button to determine the right angle. Press the joystick button to spit. Timing is the key. The Milking event has a rhythmically heaving udder indicating the beat that you must move the joystick. To fill the cans, the joystick must be moved in a predetermined pattern, but it must be moved rythmically with the udder. You can elbow your opponent to get the upper hand by moving your joystick to the right and pressing the joystick button. Dancing requires a complicated routine of joystick movements to do certain dance moves while keeping the beat. Lose the beat and the other guys bash the piano player on the head causing him to stop playing. You must buy the piano player another beer to have him resume playing. The Eating competition is the final event. Dip the spoon into the stew. Balance the spoon. Slurp. Chew. Swallow. and drink. Simple? No. If you get some out of order, you get delayed by belching. Dip the spoon by moving the joystick back. Balance the spoon by moving the joystick to the left and right.; Once leveled, slurp. Chew by again moving the joystick to the right and left. To swallow, pull the joystick back and press the joystick button. Finish it off with a drink before you dip the spoon in again, by moving the joystick forward.</desc>

		<desc>Eight invaded townships must be brought back under your control in this Commando-style shoot 'em up, which progresses vertically using a flick-screen system. You are armed with a rifle (activated by a short tap of the fire button) and five grenades (used via a longer press), and must not only kill off the enemy forces, but also rescue your comrades who have been tied to trees along the way. You begin at the bottom of the first screen and slowly make your way upwards; enemies pop up from all sides, walking around and shooting, and you have to dodge their shots while trying to shoot them yourself. The foes make good use of the decoy opportunities of the terrain, and you must do the same to have a chance. The levels include rivers with narrow bridges, potholes, and train-lines. Extra supplies are dropped in as you progress through the game, as are extra lives in addition to your starting 5.</desc>

		<name>Wild Streets</name>
		<desc>New-York, Year 1998. The once most prestigious city in the world, has now become a fighting zone. Half of the city is left in ruins, and it is in that part of town that the marginals and gangs are living, hunted by every law enforcement agencies. The other half of the city consists of fancy mansions, in some of which the most important drug barons reside. Unfortunately, they are the ones who run the city using the enormous profits they make from dealing drugs and weapons. They now have succeeded in endangering the country's economy. The U.S. government, wanting to avoid a terrible crisis, called the CIA to run several types of operations in order to get rid of this bad substitute of government. The C.I.A., headed up by "The Boss", has to clean up the city of its crooks. One plan is to reorganize the city by placing security check-points at strategic positions. The operation was set up for April 4, and quickly proved to be an unprecedented success. The badly organized, smaller street gangs, were greatly outnumbered and couldn't match the extremely well armed law enforcement troops. On May 7, during a successful raid, the state police special branch, took possession of a huge arsenal of weapons and ammunition, worth more than two million dollars. This raid was an important stage in the whole operation. Realizing the sticky situation they were in, the heads of the crime organizations now started making plans for themselves: They needed to regain their control over the city and above all, secure their territories. On May 15, they kidnapped "The Boss" in order to get from him the names of his operatives involved in the C.I.A. fight against organized crime.

You're gonna be dropped from the chopper with your panther at the spot where "The Boss" was last seen. You have your 357 Magnum ready and the panther is trained to protect you closely.

Some of them are so powerful that it would be wise to save bullets for these particular fights.

On the way back, you will have to be particularly careful, since you will have to protect "The Boss" whose physical condition has been worn out.

		<name>Wild Streets</name>
		<desc>New-York, Year 1998. The once most prestigious city in the world, has now become a fighting zone. Half of the city is left in ruins, and it is in that part of town that the marginals and gangs are living, hunted by every law enforcement agencies. The other half of the city consists of fancy mansions, in some of which the most important drug barons reside. Unfortunately, they are the ones who run the city using the enormous profits they make from dealing drugs and weapons. They now have succeeded in endangering the country's economy. The U.S. government, wanting to avoid a terrible crisis, called the CIA to run several types of operations in order to get rid of this bad substitute of government. The C.I.A., headed up by "The Boss", has to clean up the city of its crooks. One plan is to reorganize the city by placing security check-points at strategic positions. The operation was set up for April 4, and quickly proved to be an unprecedented success. The badly organized, smaller street gangs, were greatly outnumbered and couldn't match the extremely well armed law enforcement troops. On May 7, during a successful raid, the state police special branch, took possession of a huge arsenal of weapons and ammunition, worth more than two million dollars. This raid was an important stage in the whole operation. Realizing the sticky situation they were in, the heads of the crime organizations now started making plans for themselves: They needed to regain their control over the city and above all, secure their territories. On May 15, they kidnapped "The Boss" in order to get from him the names of his operatives involved in the C.I.A. fight against organized crime. This way, they were convinced they could stay in control of the situation and become even more powerful. Your mission is to liberate "The Boss" and to bring him back safely. You're gonna be dropped from the chopper with your panther at the spot where "The Boss" was last seen. You have your 357 Magnum ready and the panther is trained to protect you closely. You'll have to travel through the various parts of the city, in search of the hostage, and you will find that your street fighting skills will prove to be very useful. In each part of the city, you will confront various enemies and their gang leaders. They will become more and more skilled in combat as you progress.

Your goal is to retrieve these things and then to safely arrive at the shooting location. Wild West Seymour is an action/adventure game similar to the famous Dizzy series. It consists of 4 levels (film studio, town, desert and prairie) where you have to use both your wits and your reflex to get the necessary items and use them to solve puzzles.

		<name>Wings of Fury</name>
		<desc>Wings of Fury is an action game with some minor simulation aspects, in which you are the pilot of an American F6F Hellcat plane. The setting of the game is the Pacific during World War II. It is your job to defeat the Japanese by destroying enemy bunkers, machine gun nests and barracks on a series of islands. Barracks and gun nests can be bombarded with regular bombs, while you'll have to use rockets to take out the concrete bunkers. After a successful bombing run, return to mow down the Japanese soldiers with your machine guns. You also have to sink Japanese battleships with torpedoes and engage in dogfights with enemy fighter planes. You start each mission by taking off from an aircraft carrier, which you'll have to protect from assaults by Japanese torpedo planes. Whenever you run out of fuel, bombs, rockets or machine gun ammo you can replenish those by returning to your carrier. Your carrier is also the place to repair damage to your plane. The Gameboy Color version of Wings of Fury has a toned down violence level. You no longer mow down Japanese soldiers with your machine guns, instead you bombard jeeps &amp; trucks. Also missing in this version are the Japanese torpedo planes and the small 1st-person view window. New are some extra manoeuvres for your plane like a barrel roll and a review of your ammo consumption after each mission. Using less ammo than allocated gives you bonus points.</desc>

		<desc>In Wizball the player takes the role of the friendly wizard Wiz who can turn himself into a green ball that is able to defend his world against the color-sucking enemies who have turned his once brightly colored Wizworld into a drab planet. With his trusty feline companion Catelite, the wizard will restore the colors to the world by retrieving them from defeated enemies. The player starts out as a bouncing green ball that can shoot and be put into more or less heavy rotation to move slowly or faster, physically correct through the side-scrolling levels. The first task is to upgrade the ball by shooting the first non-moving enemies, and collect the green bubbles that are left by them. In order to stand a chance against the following moving enemy waves, some upgrades are a must. First and foremost, complete control over the ball should be activated (i.e. flying through the levels), a shield sheltering the top and bottom of the player's should be acquired, and two-way fire (left/right) should be obtained. But the extra needed to advance in Wizball is your friend Catelite who will, once summoned, take the form of a small green satellite that will imitate the ball's movement, or can be directly controlled by the player. Besides upping Wiz' fire power, Catelite is able to collect paint drops left by a certain kind of defeated enemies until the respective color pot is filled up. There's three colors available (red, green and blue), and several different combinations of them must be collected to complete a level and restore it to former colorfulness. Every color combination collected will send Wiz to a bonus stage, then to his laboratory where one of the power-ups can be made permanently. The game also features a bunch of multi-player modes, there's even a two-player cooperative mode amongst them.</desc>

		<desc>Just when things were going great with Tom-Tom and his girlfriend Tanya, some thug of a woodland king had to kidnap her and hide her away, and Tom-Tom doesn't have a clue where. That's why he has to explore deep dark forests, cross endless oceans, climb treacherous slopes, survive endless volcanoes, and even walk through clouds. But Tom-Tom will never be totally alone. You see, when he goes through the exotic locations, he has to come face to face with its inhabitants, like bees, spiders, snakes, coal-kids, frogs, bats, snails, coyotes, and octopuses, to name a few. The hatchet is Tom-Tom's only line of defense against these menaces. There are ten areas, each containing four rounds each, but the tenth area can't be accessed unless Tom-Tom collects all the dolls during his rescue mission. During his journey, he can break open different eggs that will reveal hatchets, skateboards, mushrooms, milk, and even guardian angels. You can ride the skateboard through each round, as long as you don't collide with an inhabitant. When you complete each round while still riding the skateboard, you'll start the next round still riding it. As you progress through each round, your vitality will start to get low, but it can be increased by getting milk, mushrooms, potato chips,or fruit that appear everywhere you go. As well as the normal eggs, there are also speckled eggs that must be avoided, otherwise the God of Death will be released, and once he follows you, you'll lose vitality much quickly. At the end of every fourth round, there is a king waiting to destroy you with his fireballs or lightning bolts. There are also warp-gates, but you don't find them, they find you. You see, warp-gates appear in rounds 1-4 of each area. If you happen to get one fruit, a special item will appear. These special items include handbags, wrist watches, a pair of shoes, a teddy bear, and a bottle of perfume. Another girl will appear and take you up to the clouds where the object is to collect as many hearts as you can without falling down or getting the item again. Once you have collected all the hearts, you can get the item to return to the surface, and more often than not, you'll get further in the round.</desc>

		<name>World Championship Boxing Manager</name>
		<desc>Manage a stable of 3 wannabe heavyweight world champions in this unusual twist of the standard football management style. The option are selected through an icon-based system, representing your office. Training your fighters involves deciding which areas they should work on, considering their strengths and weaknesses and any damage inflicted in previous fights, and those of their next opponent. There are 97 of these in the game, so reaching the top of the rankings will take 15-20 fights, just like real life. Choosing a beatable opponent, but one who can get your fight as high up the Friday Night bill as possible, negotiating the best financial deal, and a mutually agreeable dare, are the main considerations. Two different governing bodies are included in the game, each with subtly different rules, and a fight in one set of rules wont be viewed quite as significantly by the other. The matches are presented from the commentary box, with the 2 expert analysts exchanging textual descriptions of the key punches, and who is dong the best (a clue to how any judges decision would go). Before and during the fights you can instruct your man as to what tactics to adopt.</desc>

		<desc>Like Domark's Rugby: The World Cup, this was released alongside the 1991 Rugby World Cup, which was won by New Zealand in a final against England. Recreating this full 16-team event is an option, as are individual friendly matches and an 8-team league. Options are highly customisable - there are 10 skill levels, variable match lengths, the option to play without offsides, and variable pitch conditions. Replays can be enabled for each try, and then saved to disk. The accurate rules of rugby are recreated, including scrums, line-outs, penalties and drop goals.</desc>

		<name>Wriggler</name>
		<desc>One of the few games to set you as a maggot, in Wriggler you must negotiate the four stages of the Maggot Marathon. This involves trekking through a garden, a shrubbery, an underground lair, and finally a mansion. Viewed form above the game is maze-based, with lots of Atic Atac style sections where you can see other parts of the level on the same screen, but can't access them because the design of the maze puts something in the way. Graphics are quite large and chunky - this is perhaps the closest anyone came to borrowing Rapscallion's unusual visual design. You have an energy bar which decreases constantly, and contact with the ants, spiders and the rest of the sickly creatures reduces this further. Fortunately you can obtain apples, cherries, cups of tea (I suspect a generation of sadistic 10-year-olds started trying to ply worms with caffeine as a result of this) and other foodstuffs to recharge this. These can be eaten immediately or stored for later use, however you can only hold one object at a time. Many other items are needed to get past situations during the game, so be careful what you keep to avoid too much backtracking through the 256 screens.</desc>

		<name>WWF Wrestlemania</name>
		<desc>At the height of the World Wrestling Federation's European fame came this crunching recreation of the elaborate hammed-up action. Hulk Hogan, The Ultimate Warrior or the British Bulldog can come under your control. You play either in practice matches (against the hopefully-misnamed Mr Perfect) or in a sequence of 5 matches to win the Wrestlemania Belt. Your opponents have different special moves - watch out for The Warlord's Full Nelson and Sgt. Slaughter's Camel Clutch, for example. Before the fights start, your opponents will deliver a taunt, which you must respond to as creatively as possible. The game is a beat 'em up viewed from a forced perspective above and behind the action. Your aim is to pin your opponent to the ground for 3 seconds, which can only be done once he has been weakened. Kicks, punches and throws will reduce an opponent's strength bar. When a strong opponent is down, stamping on him will pay off more than attempting a pin. Avoid leaving the ring for too long - 20 seconds out and the match is void, which counts as a defeat. As in real WWF, the frame of the arena can be used to perform moves. Once players are in close contact, waggle the joystick to ensure you win the grapple.</desc>

		<desc>In a period of advanced technology, humanity created 30 Sentinel planets - advanced technological devices that were designed to protect us forever. Inevitably these rebel, and destroy everything in their path. Some years later, with society having declined, they must be destroyed, and this is where you come in. Gameplay has several elements, with the first task being to locate a Sentinel and guide your ship to it. Two inbuilt computers can be used to help you with this. Next you must land on the planet's surface, avoiding contact with anything as you head for the ground. The main bulk of the game sees you walk around the planet's surface, destroying all the alien craft you can find. These include dark creatures such as Tri-Syncs and Mirobs.</desc>

		<name>Xeno</name>
		<desc>Xeno is a future sport resembling Air Hockey. Each of the two players (the second being either human or computer controlled) controls a ground skimmer, which is aiming to hit a puck so as to knock it into their opponent's goal. This is done in a turn-based manner, in which each player controls a movement line which sets up their intended move before it is enacted. The arena is surrounded by walls, so rebounds (of both the puck and the skimmers) have to be factored into your shot selection. You are not required to hit the puck with a shot, so some shots can be defensive-minded. You can toggle between 1 and 9 seconds for the shot time, and between 1 and 9 minutes for the length of each of the four quarters.</desc>

		<name>Xenon</name>
		<desc>Xenon is the obscure and mysterious predecessor to the much better known Xenon 2: Megablast. The game is actually nothing like its sequel, with completely different control scheme and gameplay. The plot overlaps however, with the Xenites making their first attempt to control the galaxy. Xenon is essentially an overhead shooter, where the player controls the ship and moves around the screen. However, the difference between Xenon and its sequel is that here the player actually controls the movement of the playfield (up or down) by simply moving the ship in the direction of choice. To do this in the sequel, players need to slam your ship against the bottom of the screen and pull back on the stick in order to reverse-scroll the playfield. It also features a 3D playfield (some enemies, for example, will be mounted on hills of sort, where players can't shoot them). To combat these the player can transform its tank into a plane. The game then switches to the more familiar gameplay style as seen in other vertically scrolling shooters. The plane has to transform back into a tank again to combat most ground units. In Xenon, upgrades are taken from destroyed enemies.</desc>

A single ship escapes, piloted by a battered man who tells the tale of pods that hatch into acid-spitting Xenos. A small band of engineers has been dispatched to combat the Xeno threat before it takes over all the space stations and, eventually, your homeworld. Assemble your band of engineers and fight the Xenos on each station, striving to either clear it or abandon it. You start out with a standard issue laser, but can pick up additiona weapons as you find them, including Phasers, Lightning Rifles, Poofer guns, and bombs. Xenophobe was originally an arcade coin-op by Bally/Midway, released in 1987. Gameplay premise and setting is heavily inspired/influenced by the movie Aliens.</desc>

		<name>X-Out</name>
		<desc>In principle, this is yet another (technically very impressive) horizontally scrolling shoot-'em-up. The interesting twist about the scenario is that it doesn't play in space like the similar game R-Type and most of its clones - instead, the fight between good and evil is underwater. Through five levels, you have to shoot countless enemies, complete with the obligatory mid-level and end-level bosses. The most innovative part of this game comes after a level when you get to purchase new weapons - instead of simply buying upgrades, you can customize your ship by placing your new weapons anywhere on it.</desc>

		<name>Xybots</name>
		<desc>Xybots is either an unusually simple computer game or an unusually complex coin-op shoot 'em up, depending on your point of view. With either one or two players, you must move through a series of Gauntlet-style underground mazes, killing the bad guys and collecting health and other bonuses from flying saucers (underground? SLIGHT logic gap there, methinks).It's designed to be played co-operatively, although bullets from one player can harm the other. The Xybots are out to stop you, of course, and many have advanced attack patterns as well as bullets to fire at you. Being able to view round corners is useful, allowing you to plan a strategy - often it's good to send one player forward and let the other play the waiting game, as in Gauntlet.</desc>

		<name>Xyphoes Fantasy</name>
		<desc>The evil Kan is spreading his power over the land of Norem, using his minions called Skull. As a brave warrior, you are asked by an old magician to help him rid the land of Kan and the Skull. The basic gameplay of Xyphoes is similar to that of Shadow of the Beast or parts of Psychic World, where you walk along a monster-infested landscape and the main task is to get as far to the right as you can without losing your life. Apart from walking, ducking and jumping, your warrior can send energy waves at monsters. Potions and magic crystals upgrade your weapon or give you a protective shield. For each level, the magician demands that you find a number of magic items which will restore his power. After having cleared the platform levels, you must face one of Kan's swordsmen and defeat him, Barbarian-style. In level two, you are given a horse to ride through the landscape, similar to Shinobi III. Technically, Xyphoes Fantasy is an advanced game, made by people from the French demo scene. Running only on a 128K CPC, it features digitised music on the title screen, an in-game soundtrack, lots of colours and overscan.</desc>

There are obstacles to this, small rocks get in the way, turtles bite your ankles and pterodactyls drop rocks on you too. Also while you're away neighbours will pinch bits. Once the house is built, you have to get Fred a car so that he can get to the quarry to work, thus earning enough money to hire a dino crane to put the roof on. Progress is measured by points, these are gained as you build the house, get to work and finally find Wilma.</desc>

		<desc>A week in the life of the British Prime Minister. But not just any Prime Minister, this game puts you in the shoes of Prime Minister James (Jim) Hacker from the classic BBC television comedy "Yes, Prime Minister". Much like most political simulations, you must balance your popularity with the needs of your party, the meddling of foreign governments, and the small minded incompetence of the civil servants that surround you. All of this is played out with multiple choice dialogues between Hacker and the other cast members of the series (complete with lo-res digital pictures). The dry humor of the show abounds as you must deal with crises such as the French refusing to continue work on the channel tunnel until Waterloo station is renamed. Fans of the show will recognize much of the material and non-fans should still find enough laughs to keep them interested.</desc>

Of course this involves fighting a wide range of opponents in a traditional one-on-one 2D environment. Oolong has a wide range of attacks he can use to lower his opponent's life bar, including traditional punching and kicking attacks as well as jumping ones. Opponents are well armed with unique weapons and attacks, so Oolong's task won't be easy.</desc>

Yogi must travel across Yellowstone Park to rescue his friend Boo-Boo, who has been kidnapped. Travel through 198 screens to reach him, collecting six toffee apples en route - these are converted into a code which allows Boo-Boo to be rescued without his kidnapper raising a fuss. The park scrolls sideways, with Yogi moving into and out of the layered screens. It contains animals who can harm you on contact, as well as black holes and water hazards. Contact with the park ranger or tourists is also forbidden. Yogi must watch his energy level, which is kept up by swiping fish and pick-a-nick baskets. Boo-Boo must be rescued before he and Yogi have to hibernate for the winter.</desc>

This time, Ramses and Columbus have five new worlds to shoot their way through, beginning with the "cuddly testworld". Each new world is unlockable via a password. The levels may contain ladders and elaborate platform installations to climb (but you cannot jump!). On some levels, your beam is very short, which requires you to take great risks when trying to zap the balls.</desc>

		<desc>Zap't'Balls is most notable for its technical novelties. Amstrad experts would think it was running on a Plus, as what appear to be hardware sprites are moving smoothly at full speed. However, this was accomplished on a stock CPC by forming a stack within video RAM itself, a technique achieved by disabling interrupts. The game itself is similar to Pang. One or two players have 80 screens of balls to clear, by firing a rope vertically such that a ball will hit it. Upon doing this it splits into two balls of half the size, unless it is at the smallest size, when it will disappear. Each screen must be cleared within a time limit. Contact with a ball costs the player a life.</desc>

		<desc>Zork II: The Wizard of Frobozz is a text adventure, a sequel to the classic first Zork. Once again, the game is set in the Great Underground Empire, but this time the main goal is to face off against the titular Wizard. Like its predecessor, Zork II plays like any other text adventure: there are no graphics - only text - and the player types commands such as "lift cage" or "examine robot".</desc>

		<name>Zork III: The Dungeon Master</name>
		<desc>In the third game of the famous adventure game series Zork, you are once again a nameless adventurer, only this time you won't travel through a beautiful magical land, but are immediately cast into a deep dungeon. Like in a dream, you hear a mysterious voice telling you that you have passed all the tests but one. When conscience returns to you, you find yourself on the endless spiral of stairs, with only your trusty lantern near you... will you be able to survive the horrors of the Dungeon? Like its predecessors, "Zork III: The Dungeon Master" is a text adventure game. You read descriptions of rooms and then interact with the game by typing commands. As all early Zork games, it is very easy to get stuck in the game, so you'll have to reload several times in order to find the correct way.</desc>

		<name>Zorro</name>
		<desc>All the ingredients from the Zorro story feature in this action game - a kidnapped senorita, an evil enemy leader (Colonel Garcia) and his henchmen and of course the obligatory swordfight! This computer version of Zorro is a strange beast, he can leap across buildings, fall 50 feet and land like a feather, with neither a scratch to his head or a crease in his cape. He can also perform masterful tricks, such as balancing a large plant pot on his head, while simultaneously climbing up a ladder. Zorro has similar platform gameplay to the same company's Bruce Lee game, but with a slower pace and more puzzle elements. There are 20 different screens in the game, with The Ole Hotel screen being used continually throughout the game. The player must overcome various puzzles, including the branding of a bull and catapulting into the air via a conveniently left spring board and a dazed Garcia guard!</desc>

		<desc>Zub is a cartoon platform game, the first title developed by the brothers Ste Pickford and John Pickford as a team. In a humorous twist, every creature in the game is named Zub, including the main character. The player controls Zub, an alien warrior that received a mission from his Emperor Zub of the Zub galactic empire: to retrieve the Green Eye of Zub, a powerful artifact. Zub must ride the intergalactic elevators to reach other planets and continue the search for the Eye. The worlds are very empty, featuring a few platforms and sparsely populated by dangerous monsters called Zubs. Zub must hop to the existing platforms, position them next to each other, and keep jumping and alternating between them to ascend to the top of the level and move to the next planet. The Zubs float around the scene following the hero, trying to touch and drain some of the health energy, and have to be killed with the laser gun.</desc>

		<desc>This horizontally-scrolling shoot 'em up features 16 levels and 450 screens of Nemesis-inspired action. You pilot a spacecraft through the levels, shooting as many of the encroaching meanies and mounted turrets as possible. Power-up tokens are offered for shooting some, which can be used to obtain better weapons including ground-attack lasers, speed ups and multiple bullets. Extra lives are on offer as well, which you'll certainly need, especially as you have to go back a long way when losing a life.</desc>

		<desc>Leader Board authors Bruce and Roger Carver tried their hand at tenpin bowling, in one of the game's earliest recreations. The process of bowling the ball involves timing a succession of clicks to set the right angle, speed and curve, similarly to Leaderboard's system. Three skill levels are provided - Kids level sets the speed and hook automatically, while Amateur has more margin for error with hook/slice than professional. The game is played from a plan view, with four other (empty) lanes visible. Single matches or a league structure can be played.</desc>

		<name>1943: The Battle of Midway</name>
		<desc>The sequel to 1942, which is still a vertically scrolling shooter, has the player once again fighting over the clouds during the second world war, this time in an intense battle just off the coast of Midway islands. Updates to the gameplay include an energy bar, which can be run down by either being hit from incoming fire or using a special weapon. The energy bar can be replenished by picking up power-ups, while special weapons (lightning, cyclones and waves) can knock down all fighters on the screen at the time.</desc>
