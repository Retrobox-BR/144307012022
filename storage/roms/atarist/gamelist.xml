The process of bowling the ball involves timing a succession of clicks to set the right angle, speed and curve, similarly to Leaderboard's system. Three skill levels are provided - Kids level sets the speed and hook automatically, while Amateur has more margin for error with hook/slice than professional. The game is played from a plan view, with four other (empty) lanes visible. Single matches or a league structure can be played.</desc>

		<name>221B Baker Street</name>
		<desc>Based on the board game of the same name, 221 B Baker St. pits up to four players against each other in a race to solve mysteries set in Victorian London.  After picking a character (Sherlock Holmes, Dr. Watson, Irene Adler, or Inspector Lestrade), players select one of the thirty available mysteries and read its case file in the game's manual.  The case file presents the particulars of the case, mentions the people involved, and explains what the players need to deduce to win the game.

Solving the mysteries entails moving around London (the game board) via a roll of the dice, entering locales to collect clues, and then piecing the clues together.  Among the fifteen locations available are a pub, a park, and a bank, and each location is brought to life with voice synthesis.  Each location will have a clue, but not all clues will be useful.  

Before solving the case, players must visit Scotland Yard for a badge.  Players might also want to use a badge to lock a location with a useful clue, requiring other players to detour to the locksmith.  Once a player believes they have solved the case, they must return to Baker Street and answer a quiz.  If the player is incorrect, the other players can continue.</desc>

		<desc>Claudette the cat has been kidnapped by scientists aiming to use her for experiments. Bob Cat can't allow this, and sets off to save her.

9 Lives is a platform game taking in four levels. The lengths of jumps are variable, depending on how long the joystick is pushed down for. Bonus items to be collected include rotor blades, to allow flight. 

Bob cannot kill his enemies, but can temporarily stun them, by hurling his ball of string at them. Contact with enemies or hazards causes an energy bar to decrease - a life is lost once it reaches zero. As the title suggests, this can happen eight times before a ninth death ends the game.</desc>

Alien enemies have occupied the planet Orac in the year 2059. The Alien League Of Cosmic Nations (ALCON) has determined that you are the pilot to take the Slap Fighter (Europe) / SW475 Starfighter (US) and defeat the aliens. The main feature of the game is its pickup system. You pick up stars and then you choose which powerup you want, pick up one star and you can choose shield, two stars to choose shot, three stars to choose side shot, four for wing upgrade, five for bomb shot, six for laser shot, seven for homing missiles and eight for a shield upgrade. The homing missile is probably the most powerful weapon and the bomb is quite annoying.</desc>

		<name>ADS - Advanced Destroyer Simulator</name>
		<desc>Advanced Destroyer Simulator (ADS) is a naval combat simulation set in World War 2. It was the first naval simulation to use real-time filled 3D graphics. Its style and mechanics are reminiscent of Epyx's Destroyer (1986).

ADS simulates the H.M.S. Onslaught, a British destroyer of the O-class fitted with three cannon turrets, four torpedo tubes on port and starboard respectively, and a sonar to detect and track submarines. In ADS, the Onslaught is not part of a flotilla.

There's no campaign, gameplay is mission-based and set in three scenarios (two in the CPC version) with five mission each: The Mediterranean around Sicily, the English Channel between UK and France, and the North Sea coast of Norway. Objectives include seek-and-destroy assignments, patrols, convoy escorts, submarine hunts and blockade runs. Each scenario also offers an open “Delta” option where you cruise and hunt without specific objectives.

You navigate the destroyer manually, in real-time and from a first person perspective, though with the help of a scenario map. ADS simulates ship combat as a close-quarter exchange of torpedoes and cannon fire. In proximity to enemy land bases, Stuka fighters can attack and must be shot down with the cannons. Submarines are tracked with the sonar and can only be attacked once they surface. Enemy vessels include freighters, tankers, torpedo boats, destroyers and cruisers. Most missions are time critical; in the course of the mission, it may be necessary to dock in allied ports for repairs, to refuel and restock on ammunition.</desc>

		<desc>The game tries to represent the African part of 11th Paris-Dakar rally route, which in the game takes place in Tunisia, Algeria, Niger, Burkina Faso, Mali, and Senegal in 1988-1989.

Controlling his(her) car in third-person 'behind the car' view, player should drive through the marked path in Sahara. When player loses his(her) way, he(she) may be in the sands alone and start to skid. In this situation he(she) may switch between 4x4 and 4x2 modes of the car. These modes have own opportunities and misses. The speed is limited to 87 in 4x4 mode and limited by car's parameters in 4x2 mode. But in 4x4 mode path marks may stop the car, while in 4x2 mode the car may knock the path parks off. Switching the gear, player may drive back and forth to avoid blocking of car either by path mark or by debris in the sand. Direction of the way is shown by compass as well as length of traversed path and volume of residuary fuel are displayed by indicators.

Other drivers are present on the way during day and night, therefore they should be left behind to win in the rally. There are five stages with different visible horizons:
1) Tunis - In Salah (5726 Km); 
2) Ouallene - Achegour (4353 Km); 
3) Achegour - Niamey (4587 Km); 
4) Ouagadougou - Bamako  (4438 Km); 
5) Bamako - Dakar (3622 Km).

So, you have to conquer the sands of Sahara, show good time on each stage, and to be the first at the finish.</desc>

		<desc>The aliens are invading Earth, and it's up to the "Alien Busters" to wipe them out and destroy their creator. The Busters consist of Karla, Gordon, and Scooter. Each one of them have their own weapons and special attacks.

When you start the game, you can select any one of these characters to play as. There are six missions to complete (eight in the Genesis version) with several stages, and each mission has you blasting aliens all the way to the end, from the streets to the mother ship where you'll meet the mother of all aliens. Unfortunately, blasting these aliens will not be an easy task, as they get tougher in every mission, and are capable of hiding into objects such as plants, postboxes, trashcans, drums, and several others. Each mission has an objective such as rescuing people destroying an UFO.

When you deal with a few aliens, flying heads will appear, which you can shoot to collect life or energy (by the way, life is important to you, since if yours get empty, you're dead). However, rather than using your ordinary weapons, you can use the special attacks that are enough to kill aliens you currently see. These types of attack vary depending on the character you choose at the start of the game. For instance, Gordon summons a U.S. Air Force Jet that drop bombs across the street, while Scooter is able to teleport out of his present location, and leave a series of bombs that will blow up aliens on sight, he will then re-appear. However, using your character's special attack uses up a lot of energy, and if you have little or no energy, you can't use it.

At the end of some missions is an alien boss, which you must destroy in order to complete the mission. Also, at the end of every one, you have to enter buildings where you participate in a shooting gallery. The object is to kill aliens popping up from several locations with the building. 

You can play Alien Storm by yourself, or with another person.</desc>

		<desc>You are a hero raised from the dead by the god Zeus to rescue his daughter Athena. With scenery inspired by Ancient Greece, you have to fight hordes of undead and demons, with a boss at the end of each level until you meet the god Neff, who holds the girl captive. The Altered Beast title refers to your shapeshifting abilities. In this platformer, you can collect spirit balls by defeating two-headed wolves, allowing you to mutate into different beasts such as a werewolf, a dragon, a tiger, a bear and others depending on the version. Each form, tied to a level, comes with special abilities such as flight and powerful attacks, easily superseding the basic set of punches and kicks in your human form.</desc>

		<desc>As a Defender clone, Anarchy is a sidescrolling parallax shooter, in which you take on the evil Anarchists and their destructive behaviour. Your ship moves left or right on a looping level, shooting the enemies and finally the bosses. You have a single life with gradually draining energy. No less than 50 High Scores are recorded.

There are no surprises in gameplay, except the usual upgrades for your ship - X-shaped pods reveal circles, which can be collected to produce multiple fire beams, multi-directional shots, and drones with advanced cannons

The action is fast and smooth, and anybody looking for a straight shooter might take a glimpse, although the reviews from the magazines mostly ranged from bad to mid-class.

Anarchy was released under Psygnosis label Psyclapse. The manual comes in four languages: English, French, German and Italian.</desc>

		<desc>Antago is a puzzle game played on a 5x5 square board. It can be played either against the computer, with a choice of up to 10 levels of difficulty, or against another human player. Other options allow you to play a match or start a training session, as well as select between "plain" (empty board) and "prepared" (pre-arranged balls on the board) game modes. A demo mode is also available, where the computer plays against itself.

An angel and a devil compete against each other, with the goal of aligning five "balls" in a row on the board, either horizontally, vertically or diagonally. They are moved around the board with the joystick, pushing each other as their paths cross, and strategically placing balls on the edge of the board to both disrupt their opponent's lines and try to create a line of 5 of their own balls.

Each level features different background and board graphics. There is no background music playing during the game, and only basic sound effects when the two characters push each other, place a ball on the board and win.</desc>

		<name>Archipel</name>
		<desc>Archipelagos is a real-time puzzle and strategy game with an unconventional premise and equally unconventional gameplay.

In the future, man carelessly poisons the earth with nuclear waste. The polar ice caps have melted, turning the surface of the earth into many islands of decaying land masses, known as Archipelagos. Man then built systems to try to clean up the pollution, but these failed. The only life left were genetically-altered plants made in an effort to clean up the waste -- these also turned hostile. It is up to you to clean up the earth, island by island.  

Controlling a hoversphere, it is up to you to make Earth's many islands of land habitable. To do this, you need to knock out the radiation generators on each island, which can be done by knocking out each generator's power sources (there are several per island). Once these are knocked out, you have 90 seconds to get back to the generator and disable it before it melts down, taking you with it.

Obstacles, unfortunately for you, are plentiful: You can't knock out a power source unless it is connected by a "land bridge" to the generator. You have the ability to create land where needed, but this takes up energy, and you have a limited supply. Also a hindrance are the many genetically-altered entities left behind on the islands: Viral trees that poison the ground; necromancers (former hoverspheres) that now erode land instead of creating it; eco eggs that explode on touch; and aircleaners, who are ruthlessly efficient in cleaning up the air -- and everything else, including you.

The entire game plays from a 3D first-person viewpoint. A movable cursor selects where to move or what to manipulate.

There are 10,000 islands on Earth to purify. If you can make it past Archipelago #100, you are then free to select any of them.</desc>

		<name>Arkanoid</name>
		<desc>The original Breakout concept involves controlling a bat at the bottom of the screen and using it to catch and direct a ball so as to hit all the bricks which are arranged at the top of the screen. It was unpopular for over a decade, before Taito revived it with some new ideas in this arcade game.

The game's plot redefines the bat as a Vaus spaceship, the ball as an energy bolt, and the bricks form a mysterious wall stopping the ship from progressing to safety.

By the mid-80s, power-ups were popular in most types of arcade games, and Arkanoid features them. They are caught by positioning the bat below them as they fall (meaning that you risk missing the ball if you go for them at the wrong time). The power-ups include lasers (which are mounted to each side of the ship and allow you to shoot out the blocks), a catching device (so as to be able to fire the ball off at a different angle every time you hit it) and one that slows the ball.... sorry, bolt.... down. Needless to say, the game inspired tonnes of clones, few of which added anything else.</desc>

Many squares featuring a variety of power-up type effects, such as improved weaponry, extra lives, a level warp, a device to stop the landscape's (otherwise constant) scrolling (thereby giving you a chance to 'pick off' the aliens more carefully), and one which speeds up the aliens (avoid this!). You can move backwards a short way, but it takes a few squares' worth of screen to get fully across the screen, so bear this in mind in the mazier sections.</desc>

Based on the second installment of the popular Hollywood series Back to the Future, this movie conversion has Marty McFly and Doc Brown travel through time to stop their arch-rival Biff from changing the future. The game consists of five parts, each inspired by one of the movie's most memorable scenes:

1. Hoverboard Chase: A Paperboy clone without newspapers, but with isometric levels and lots of enemies to dodge.
2. Jennifer Rescue: Guide Marty's girlfriend Jennifer out of the house without her meeting one of the four family members. Open and close doors to make the persons go from one room to the next in this top-down puzzle sequence.
3. Beat Biff: A side-scrolling beat-em-up sequence in the tradition of Double Dragon. Fight your way through a grim 1985 by jumping, hitting and kicking at Biff's lackeys.
4. Band Puzzle: Rearrange the mixed-up parts of an animated picture of the school band in this sliding block puzzle. The clock is ticking.
5. Hoverboard Chase 2: Another hoverboard sequence, similar to the first one, only this time set in 1955.</desc>

Marty McFly and Doc Brown have traveled back through time to the year 1885 - and they're soon deep in trouble when they face "Mad Dog" Tannen's gang and have to find a way to return to the present. This game takes four scenes from the Hollywood movie Back to the Future III and turns them into arcade sequences:

1. Buckboard Chase: Doc Brown goes horseback in an attempt to save Hill Valley's lovely school teacher Clara. This game of quick ducking, jumping and shooting alternates between a side-scrolling and a top-down perspective.

2. Shooting Gallery: The name says it all. A classic game of aim-and-shoot, spiced up by hidden extras and bonus targets.

3. Pie Throwing: Meet the Mad Dog gang. They have guns, and you have... cream pies. It's an isometric version of the shooting gallery, only with ammo. And the targets shoot back.

4. The Train: Basically a side-scrolling beat-em-up on train wagons with some ducking and jumping. Get rid of the mechanics and collect speed logs to push the engine to a magic 88 mph.</desc>

		<name>Bad Company</name>
		<desc>The plot of "Bad Company" is quickly told: Earth is dying and mankind needs new worlds to colonize, the Nu-Worlds. You and your (optional) companion have the task to clear those worlds from hostile alien insectoids.

"Bad Company" is played in a pseudo-3D view (third person) that very much resembles that of Space Harrier games.
Before you start to play you'll have to choose one of the eight offered troopers as your player character. This decision will influence gameplay later on, e.g. you won't be able to carry a specific weapon or your character is especially fast, and so on. When it comes to the action you'll be confronted with several different alien types including "level bosses".You battle these foes by using one of the four available weapon systems (equipment can be changed in the course of the game). You have full movement control over your character, meaning the screen isn't auto-scrolling like in comparable games. You can also take cover behind certain obstacles or choose to blow them up.

The game extends over four levels (the four Nu-Worlds).</desc>

The races consist of 3 souped-up cars toughing it out over 4 laps on one of the 8 tracks, which are viewed from above. Two human players can take part, but only the winner continues without using up credits, so you will only see the early races in two-player mode. 

You are armed with guns, which can be used to slow opposing cars. During the races spanners can be collected, which are then cashed in for upgraded turbos, improved weaponry and engine upgrades. Hazards on the later tracks include ramps, bridges, buildings collapsing onto the track and barriers which open and close in a random sequence.</desc>

		<name>Balance of Power</name>
		<desc>The year is 1986. You take on the role of the US President or the Russian General Secretary. You have the full industrial capacity, covert forces, and military might of your country at your command. Your job? To make your country the world's most powerful and prestigious over the course of your 8 years in office. Sounds easy, doesn't it? It would be if the other guy didn't have his finger poised over a red button that could wipe out the world! 

You must use diplomacy, make treaties, issue risky, covert CIA or KGB actions, or riskier, direct military intervention to prop up 3rd world countries or help their insurgents and win them to your governmental philosophy: Capitalism or Communism. The world is a big place... and the other guy could start a nuclear war over a country as tiny as Tunisia. This game is the ultimate Cold War simulation. Every action requires careful analysis and the ability to judge your opponent (computer or human) and his reaction.

The game features 62 countries, each carefully researched with up to date (as of 1985) information regarding their government, demographics, resources, etc.  This game is very challenging, and will keep you up for hours. Be sure to try playing against a human too... it adds a whole new dimension.</desc>

Elite go beyond this by changing the shapes of the ships to be more Tetris style, and allowing these to be placed at each of the 4 main angles. A ‘Salvo Fire’ mode sees each player fire a succession of shots (each of your six ships gets four shots a turn until it’s sunk), meaning that strategic play involves firing on a wide range initially in the hope of finding a ship, before homing in on the area in the next turn.

As well as standard two-player games, there’s also a multi-player mode in which the winner’s score accumulates until he loses, allowing for a “winner stays on” structure if there are 3 or more of you.</desc>

		<name>Better Dead Than Alien!</name>
		<desc>Brad Zoom takes on the Brain Eaters from the Purple Planet, in this homage to vintage action games, primarily Galaxians. There are 75 levels, accessed via passcodes.

You control a spaceship at the bottom of the screen facing upwards, firing at arrangements of aliens. You can move up and down as well as left and right as you shoot them. At set intervals an alien will emerge from the main pack and sweep down towards you. 

Other levels feature Asteroids which split when shot, or a single ‘boss’ alien. Aliens with green eyeballs release power-ups, such as improved weapons, shields and bombs. You have a single life with which to survive the carnage. You get points for surviving as well as scoring, so slow but cautious play is more rewarding.</desc>

"That will be my dinner", - thought Big Nose, took out his trusty club and ran after the winged reptile. Naturally, his quest for nutrition became much longer and more dangerous than he had ever imagined...

In this platform action game, you guide Big Nose through prehistoric levels, fighting prehistoric animals of various kinds. Big Nose starts out with his club, but will gain other, more powerful weapons. During your quest you can collect bones, which are the currency of the game. There are shops in which you can buy weapons and various spells that you'll be able to cast.</desc>

In this case the Asteroids are protecting Mukor, an evil being who is poisoning planets under the Colonising Corp’s control.
Each level is split into either 9 or 16 sub-levels, which are chosen through a square in which any remaining level which is adjacent to the last level completed can be selected. There are 3 different ships (Speeder, Fighter and Warrior), which can be switched between at any time. Power-ups (including improved weapons, shield recharges and a faster thrust) can be collected by flying into them.</desc>

The levels themselves are flick-screen and are layered with platforms. Making the task difficult are spiders, mice and the like - watch out in particular for the jumping frogs.

		<name>Bobo</name>
		<desc>The game Bobo is an cartoon style arcade game.
The main character is Bobo - controlled by you - he is an inmate and has been sentenced for 17 years.
In this game inmate Bobo must do many chores, such as peeling potatoes, ladling soup to his fellow prisoners, helping his fellow prisoners to escape, jumping electric wires and singing lullabies to his snoring cell mates.

Besides playing all events it is possible to select and play just one event.
Up to six player can play this game by entering their names. They play alternating not simultaneously

Each event can be played by joystick or keyboard. The specific moves you have to make vary from event to event but it come basically down to moving the joystick or keyboard keys fast from left to right. To pick things up you have to move the joystick downwards (keyboard arrow key down). Tossing things is done by moving the joystick up (when using the keyboard you have to press cursor key up).

Below you 'll find a brief description of each event:

Bobo has a job in the prisons canteen. He must serve soup to the other inmates and keep their soup plates full. To do this Bobo must move around the tables. When his supply of soup is empty he must refill it at the top of the screen where a new supply of soup is available. If his fellow inmates demand more soup they  start banging and hammering on the tables. The score of this event is based on how many plates of soup he hands out.

Peeling potatoes is not Bobo's favorite chore but he has to do it. He has to pick up a potato, then peeling it and when that's done tossing it away. Bobo scores points based on the number of potatoes he has peeled. If a potato is not fully peeled it will be tossed back.

In the next event Bobo must help his inmates to escape prison. The inmates are jumping out of their cell windows and it is Bobo's task to get them over the prison wall by moving a trampoline around. 
The score is based on how many inmates actually can escape. Bobo must be sure to catch the inmates under the right angle with his trampoline because if he fails the inmates will crash into the prison wall.

Finally, Bobo found an way to escape prison. He must jump from wire to wire and as the wires are electrified he must take care not to be electrocuted. The score in this event based on how long Bobo can prevent being electrocuted. Bonus points can be earned by picking up the green objects that appear occasionally on the wires

In the last event Bobo has been captured by the police and returned to his cell. He can't sleep because his cell mates are snoring and to stop it he has to sing lullabies to them. He has to climb the beds and not wake his cell mates by stumbling around his cell. When all cell mates are fast asleep Bobo himself must go to bed to get some rest himself. The score in this event is based on the time Bobo is actually able to sleep himself.</desc>

In each round, collecting a number of bombs results in a bonus coin appearing, and collecting this coin will make the player's score increase 2 to 4 times. More often than not, the "power ball" appears, and when you collect this, you can defeat enemies and have more time to collect all the bombs. There is also the "E" coin, which gives Jack one additional life, but rarely does this coin appear.

The more you progress through the game, the more difficult it becomes, as enemies travel more quickly to get you.</desc>

So as one might imagine, later levels turn into loud blastfests that need to be carefully planned.

Besides, later levels introduce all kinds of additional hazards and gimmicks, like ice floors, movable bombs, disappearing ground tiles, and much more. Nobody said being a pyromaniac is easy.</desc>

		<desc>Bubble Bobble is the story of two humans, Bub and Bob who wander into the mysterious cave of monsters and magically turn into dinosaurs. The only way to transform back is to reach the end of the cave...

Bubble Bobble is a platform game, with each level being a single screen. The enemies must be cleared from a level to go to the next one. With one player controlling Bub and the other controlling Bob, the player can jump and collect items for points (such as fruit). The real power Bub and Bob have however is the ability to blow bubbles. These bubbles can be as platforms to leap on, or to trap enemies. Enemies trapped in a bubble must be popped by jumping into them, wherein they'll turn to fruit. Additionally, power-ups sometimes float by in bubbles. They include lightning, which flies out horizontally at enemies, and water, which drags the player and enemies straight down flowing over platforms. Taking too long to complete any level will summon Baron Von Blubba, who will float around the screen trying to destroy the player.</desc>

You must guide Dizzy through the underwater worlds, collecting pearls as you go. Dizzy starts at the bottom of the sea, and you have to get him to the top. You do this by jumping across bubbles, which only have a limited time before bursting. Enemies to avoid include sharks, octopuses and swordfish. Dizzy has limited oxygen, but more can be collected from O2 canisters. 

After completing a level, you get a bonus for the amount of pearls you collected and the amount of oxygen you have left.</desc>

		<desc>Guide a team of up to four soldiers through 72 levels of combat in this innovative top-down action/strategy hybrid, best thought of as Lemmings crossed with Commando crossed with Dune 2. The characters are controlled indirectly using the mouse, as you activate each soldier or group of them by highlighting them, click the left button to move them to a particular spot, and the right button for them to fire guns at an enemy. You can also pick up grenades, which can be used to destroy groups of enemies or buildings (by pressing both buttons at once). 

Each mission has a specific objective, and some feature vehicles such as tanks to make things easier. Your troops can cross water but can't shoot within it, so finding and controlling bridges is often crucial. You can use the arrangement of trees to find hiding places to shoot from, and should watch out for CPU soldiers also doing so.</desc>

		<name>Carrier Command</name>
		<desc>Carrier Command was one of the first real-time strategy games.

You control an advanced cybernetic aircraft carrier complete with fighters, amphibious assault vehicles, laser defenses and a fleet of decoy drones.  Your mission is to build a series of resource, factory, and defensive bases spanning an island chain.  The only problem?  At the other end of the chain is an even more advanced carrier under control of a terrorist organization with the same mission.

As you move around the islands you must decide what facilities to build and where they will best support your advance.  Resource islands provide materials that factory islands can use to build weapons and vehicles to replace your combat losses but both will be quickly overrun if the enemy attacks them while you are not present.  You also have to ensure that your stockpiles of equipment are stored safely until you can find time to launch a resupply drone to bring them to your carrier.

From your carrier, you can take first person control of your attack aircraft and amphibious tanks and use them to assault enemy islands or even the enemy carrier itself if you're lucky enough to find it.  The weapon payloads on your vehicles are completely configurable based on your needs.  An island invasion may require launching a virus bomb that will take over the enemy command systems or just blasting the base with a wire guided surface to surface missile.

Ultimately, you have to find and destroy the enemy carrier but, doing so will require a solid supply infrastructure and a strategy for depriving your opponent of his.</desc>

		<desc>In this traditional baseball simulation, gameplay takes place mainly on a split screen.One side shows an overview of the field, the other showing the batter, with the latter view disappearing when the ball is hit.

The game requires you to "draft" a team before play, composing the best possible squad based on each player's skill attributes. The game also allows a semblance of managerial control, and has an optional batting practice mode to warm up. It then allows you to play individual games, or participate in a 4 division, 24-team championship.</desc>

You are given a mission briefing before you start which gives information on the suspect and what car they drive. Then you drive across the city without crashing into other cars, and catch up with the criminal's car. To arrest the suspects, you must keep bumping into their car until it is no longer functional. And you have to do this under a strict time limit. You can't afford to crash into cars or buildings or you waste time getting on the road again. 

However, once you've caught up with your suspect, you are given more time. Your car is also equipped with turbo boosts, which you can use to gain extra speed if you are way behind the criminal. Each arrest is based on a "suspicion".</desc>

The author was not shy about his program's prowess.  Built into the program is a pull-down menu, giving it's performance against Chessmaster 2000, Chessmaster 2100 and Colossus X, in 10 games apiece.

The game was designed to improve as it played, so over time a game that played against good players would be much better than when it first began.  Users have the option of saving, so that the gained intelligence isn't lost.

Although the author clearly wanted the game to be used by serious chess players, he included whimsical chess pieces as well.  One set includes farm animals (sheep pawns, dog rooks, horse knights, chicken bishops, cow queens, and pig kings); Another setting includes Science-Fiction pieces that look like aliens. The game can be played in 2D or 3D, and includes digitised speech on the Amiga version.</desc>

		<desc>As a professional ornithologist, you're thrilled to find out that some rare South American hornbills have nested in your "old yolk tree." But while the hornbills are out feeding, a group of mischievous bluebirds, owls, and snakes begin raiding their nests and stealing eggs.

You get out your slingshot and begin hitting the marauding creatures. But you have to be careful. If you hit an egg-carrying bird, it drops the egg and you have to act fast to catch it before it hits the ground and return it to a nest. At the same time, you have to watch for snakes that may be sneaking up to nests and gobbling eggs. If you can protect the eggs long enough, you can take them to another nesting site.</desc>

		<name>Crash Garrett</name>
		<desc>Crash Garrett is an adventure in the mold of the classic 1930s film serials: you take on the role of dashing Crash Garrett, a flying ace who makes a living by flying rich Hollywood types around on private flights across the west coast of the United States. As the game opens, Garrett is taking journalist Cynthia Sleeze to an exclusive interview with a high-powered psychoanalyst to the stars, as part of a red-hot story. He soon becomes entangled in the story himself, and must use his wits, cunning and fists to save the day.

While the game takes typed commands, the action is shown as a sort of animated comic book. There is a background image that sets the scene (it may be a mini-map, that shows Garrett's current location marked with a red X) and on top of this are comic book panel-like portraits of the characters currently in the scene, that move around the screen and speak in speech bubbles. Some versions of the game use synthesized speech, but only when Garrett addresses the player, for "What do you want to do now?"-type prompts.</desc>

		<desc>Cricket Captains have a much greater role than their equivalents in most sports. Most major tactical decisions during the match ultimately come under their control, as they do in this simulation, in which you can play or merely watch the match action. Teams are real but the player names are fictitious.

Your options are quite similar to those of a soccer manager. You must hire a coach, scout and physio to enable you to train your players and keep them fit, and to acquire new ones through the soccer-style transfer market. 

You must select your team of 11 players before the match, with talented all-rounders more common than in real-life. The game takes in the four main tournaments of the time - a single-division league of four-day unlimited-overs matches, the Sunday League of one-day games, and two cup competitions.

The match view features a plan view of the fielding setup, and a forced-perspective view of the batsman as a shot is lined up. You must time and place your shot correctly in order to score off it. When fielding you can choose the bowler and alter the field setup.</desc>

As always you can carry only one part with you that means you'll have to be careful when travelling through the weird landscapes.

Your task is being done harder by various type of monsters that keep running after you and often decrease your energy level. But you may shoot them with spits of sperm.

		<name>Darius +</name>
		<desc>Darius was Taito's effort to compete in the arcades against the likes of R-Type and Gradius. Technically impressive, it featured three screens depicting the largest playfield seen in a game so far (the same system was employed for Ninja Warriors), with the player sitting atop a big set of loudspeakers. Visually and audibly, it was a league above Irem's and Konami's offerings.

When Taito (and others) ported the game to home machines, they were forced to shrink the playfield to fit in one single screen, and re-dubbed it Darius Plus.

The plot of Darius involves the two heroes Proco Jr. and Tiat Young fighting the menaces posed by galactic fish and other sea animals again their homeworld.

What sets Darius apart from other shoot'em-ups of the time is its way of letting the player choose his path with a certain amount of freedom. At the end of each area (level), you are able to choose between one of two worlds which the area branches into. This renders a higher replay value, since there are many paths to reach the end of the game by.
Apart from this, the gameplay is on the simplistic side, both due to unimaginative attack waves and little interaction with the surroundings, but mainly due to the very basic powerup system, which is nowhere near the complexity of the aforementioned R-Type's and Gradius'.</desc>

		<desc>Tom Cruise's film brought NASCAR racing to the masses, and Mindscape did the same for games players with this license. If you mentally change the driver names, it can be thought of as a recreation of real NASCAR racing rather than a direct recreation of the film. 

You play Cruise's Cole Trickle character (his name, like many of the others, is slightly different to that of a real NASCAR racer of the day) against your rivals on 8 tracks, based on real-life counterparts. The races are all on ovals, although the exact lengths, corner types and gradients are varied.  This means that the ideal racing line on one track can put you into the wall on another. Qualifying is incorporated alongside the races themselves.

From times to times you'll have to pull into the pit stop area. When doing so, you control the five members of the pit crew. Loosing time on pit will make you loose positions at the race. The other racers, however, never pit.

The NES version has 3rd-Person perspective only.</desc>

		<desc>Defender of the Crown puts you in the role of one of four Saxon knights in medieval England, in a time where the land is in turmoil as the King is dead and his crown was stolen. The Saxons and the Normans blame each other and fight for control of England.

After a short introduction by Robin of Locksley himself, you start the game with a single castle and 10 soldiers at your command. From there, you have to build your army, take control of additional territories and fight the three Norman lords - and sometimes your Saxon friends as well.

The game has several different styles: You may either engage in a jousting contest where you have to knock your opponent off his horse using a lance, you can go raid a castle for loot or you can attack another territory/castle.

The game was originally created on the Amiga platform in 1986 by Cinemaware with wonderful graphics by James D. Sachs and great music by Jim Cuomo, then ported to the PC whilst keeping its original appeal and quality.</desc>

In Deja Vu, action takes place in Chicago in December 1941. Your character's name is Theodore "Ace" Harding - a retired boxer working as a private eye. He wakes up in a toilet stall of a sleazy pub with no memory of who he is or what he is doing there. To make matters worse, you as him soon stumble upon a very dead corpse upstairs with three bullets buried in him. Sure enough, you find there's a gun in your pocket with three bullets missing. From there you have to figure out what happened and who you are before whatever is happening to your brain turns you into a mindless vegetable. To make matters worse the cops would very much like to have a word with you about that stiff.</desc>

Each room of the house is viewed isometrically, and contains all the features you would expect to find in a large house, from cookers and telephones to pool tables and paintings. Each one can be picked up, pushed, pulled and used, with the diamonds located in intricate and surprising places. 

Due to Mr. Croucher's keen interest in experimental science, there are also monsters moving through the rooms. Contact with these reduces some of the energy on one of your 3 lives.</desc>

Together, they manage a small martial arts training school, teaching their students in self-defense. One day, Billy's girlfriend, Marian, is kidnapped off the street by the "Black Warriors", a savage street gang led by a man named Willy. The Black Warriors demand the Lee brothers disclose their martial arts secrets in exchange for Marian's freedom. The Lee brothers set out on a rescue mission to crush the Black Warriors and save Marian.

Using whatever techniques they have at their disposal, from the basic punches and kicks to the invulnerable elbow strike, as well any weapon that comes into their hands, the Lee brothers must pursue the gang through the city slum, industrial area and the forest before reaching their hideout to confront the big boss, Willy.

The NES version of this game also has an additional VS. fighting mode for one or two players. Players choose from a field of six different characters (Billy and 5 of the enemy characters) and enter into a one-on-one fighting match. Players have to punch, kick, jumpkick, and even use a weapon against their opponents until someone's health bar is fully drained. The winner is the last one standing.</desc>

		<name>Dozer</name>
		<desc>Dozer is a variation on the "indirectly guiding creatures to safety" kind of puzzle game, typified by Lemmings. Here there is only one creature you need to guide: a small red dinosaur, that walks endlessly in circles around the perimeter of the blocks that it is adjacent to. You control a small bulldozer that is able to push blocks around the level, altering the dinosaur's path and eventually leading it back to its cage. Not all blocks can be pushed however, and even when a block is pushable, it might not be pushable from all sides. The sides of a block that can be pushed are indicated by a green triangle, pointing inwards.</desc>

		<name>Dragon Breed</name>
		<desc>Zambaquous has done everything to make life hell for the people of Agamen, and as their King Kayus, the time has come to head out to destroy him. This leads to six levels of horizontally-scrolling shoot ‘em up action, although with some vertical movement as well.

The thing which sets the game apart from every other horizontally-scrolling shoot ‘em up (except Saint Dragon) is that you are riding on the back of a dragon, called Bahamoot. Both you and the dragon have firepower, and holding down the fire button increases Bahamoot’s energy bolt’s ferocity. The dragon’s tail can be controlled indirectly, and because it is indestructible, it can be used either as a shield, or as a weapon in its own right. 

There are power-ups to collect by dismounting from the dragon and walking into them. These include fiery breath, bolts shot from Bahamoot’s tail, homing missiles of sorts, and lightning bolts, with only one ever active at a time. Each level has a time limit.</desc>

		<name>Duck Tales - The Quest for Gold</name>
		<desc>This game follows the adventures of Scrooge McDuck and his three nephews, Huey, Dewey and Louie. 
 
The aim of the game is shown in the introduction. Flintheart Glomgold challenges Scrooge to a competition to see who the richest duck in the world is. They each have 30 days to see who can get the most money together and finally their dispute will be settled. 
 
Scrooge's office is your headquarters. Here you have three options ? you can go exploring for treasure, play the stock market or dive into your money bin, occasionally finding a rare coin which adds to you treasure total. You need to get some money first before you can play the stock market though. 
 
You main source of income comes from the exploration map which hangs on the wall. From here, you can pick a destination, which you can travel to. There are four different scenarios when travelling to various parts of the world. It's these levels that are the most fun. You can choose to go mountain climbing, jungle bashing, search a cavern, or photograph some rare animals depending on your location. On screen information tells you which scenario it is, how long the trip will take and how much the treasure is worth. There's also an island in the Indian Ocean you can visit to check on who's winning between you and Glomgold. 
 
You have to fly to each location and your transport is LaunchPad McQuack! You have to take off at the airport and fly to the destination. There are obstacles along the way though, watch out for powerlines (these are really funny, you run into them and boing! bounce back); hot air balloons dropping refrigerators, anvils, 10 ton weights and pianos; cumulo nimbus clouds shooting lightening and fluffly clouds; whales blowing water out their spouts; tall mountains, rocky outcrops, fireworks, hay barns among other things. Landing on the other side requires a special skill ? Launchpads! You have to crash into the airport to land! Crash the plane though and it takes two days of your valuable time limit for Gyro Gearloose to fix it. 
 
Using Huey, Dewey and Louie, each being one of your three lives in the mountain climbing level, you must get from the base of the mountain to the top to get your treasure. Using the boys, you can hop from ledge to ledge, or when the going gets tough, use your grappling hook! This is a lot of fun and requires precision. There are also caves in the side of the mountain, which can transport you up or down the mountain. But watch out for bears in the caves. Other obstacles include falling rocks, the Beagle Boys dropping objects from above, mountain goats, Magica de Spell and more. 
 
The jungle features Scrooges' nephews again. Here you must use swinging vines, branches and even hippopotamus' backs to get to the treasure. Sleeping pumas, snakes, macaws and monkeys hamper you progress. 
 
Searching a cavern involves Scrooge, his nephews and niece, navigating a maze using the map at the bottom of the screen to get to the treasure whilst avoiding the yeti tracking them down. 
 
Photography, with Webbigail, Scrooge's niece, involves her taking snaps of rare animals in a forest. Some animals get you more money for your snaps than others. 
 
Once the thirty day marker is reached, whoever has the most gold between Scrooge and Glomgold is the winner.</desc>

Being able to use direct-combat moves as well as collecting bonus weapons, and food for energy recharging, is pretty typical as well. Games of this type that were converted from the arcade to home computers are particularly commonplace - Renegade and the Double Dragon series are famous examples.

Where this one stands out, however, is the setting of your character as a duck called Bin, and with motion having a clear waddling appearance. The enemies to fight are all from the animal kingdom, but somewhat warped - crocodiles with boxing moves and cows armed with rocket packs for example. Bin has six levels to clear before he can rescue Lucy from Archaca's clutches. </desc>

Once this is done, you are taken to a screen displaying the species' genes, and you have the chance to modify one of them, thus resulting in evolution.

		<desc>Esprit is the predecessor of the Oxyd series of games from Dongleware, sharing the basic idea, control and many gameplay elements with those games. Control method and physical effects are heavily influenced by the earlier Bolo. 
 
You control a ball in a world with physical rules, like acceleration and gravitation. On touching regular stones, they reveal a symbol. You have to open two stones with the same symbol in a row to lock them. When all stones are locked, the level is finished. Therefore the goal of the game is the same as in Memory. Save controlling the ball, which can only be done with the mouse, in a world with ice on the floor, bumpers catapulting the ball in a different direction or with gravity spots attracting the ball, is very crucial element of gameplay, too. There are many special purpose items to find, some notes are giving you hints, contain the level codes for later start in this level, allowing level skips and more. 
 
Overall there are 100 levels which can be accessed with passwords.</desc>

		<desc>This action game combines shoot 'em up and platform elements, as you control a flying man who can gain an exoskeletal suit for extra protection (hence the name). Your task is to progress from left to right in each level, either along the ground or by using the arrangement of platforms. Most of the baddies can be avoided rather than shot, and this is often easier, especially as you can duck or jump to avoid them. As well as a standard gun (activated by tapping fire) you also have a limited number of missiles to take out installations (activated by holding down fire, which makes autofire facilities useless). The scrolling is flick-screen, perhaps as the game was designed for the C64, and the Amiga version was identical to the ST's.</desc>

		<name>Extase</name>
		<desc>The screen display in Extase depicts a symmetrical network of wires, some buttons, some fuses, some switches, and a picture of a female android in the middle. The overall aim is to restore sensory functions to the android, one in each level. All of this is done against an opponent, either human or computer, who controls the opposite half of the board.

This is done by guiding electrical pulses through each of the wires, however this can only be done once the wires have been woken up. You are in control of a cursor, which can click on the activation buttons to release a ball, which you direct using the cursor to reactivate wires on its path. Switches must be set to make all parts of this available – this can only be done when no ball is active.

Electrical sparks move around to make life harder, by destroying balls and fuses. Fortunately these can be 'zapped' using the cursor. New fuses can be generated by guiding a power beam into the fusebox, which is located centrally – simply pick up and place a generated fuse.

Better still, you can steal your opponent's, which is one of many ways the game becomes directly competitive. The two cursors cannot occupy the same space on screen, so hitting your opponent's cursor will jolt it. You can also adjust switches on both sides of the board, and summon sparks for your opponent to deal with. As the android is reactivated during the level it shows a range of facial expressions as a visual reward and measure of your progress.</desc>

It is up to you to plan your flight route by setting waypoints on the tactical map prior to take-off; you can also (but need not) select the armament of your plane. When you have accumulated enough flight experience, you may command entire squadrons in the fictional Operation Conquest campaign, a simple simulation of an entire war theater that already hinted at what would later become DI’s Virtual Battlefield.

		<desc>Final Blow is an action game based around the sport of boxing. You can play the fighters in a sequence of knock-out competitions, (the computer versions also include a round-robin league). Rounds last one minute, with a short break in between them. As in the real sport, your aim is to knock your opponent down for 10 seconds, by gradually weakening him with a series of punches. You can block punches, to avoid them inflicting damage onto you. The ring is of a limited size, so players can be cornered, although the referee will intervene to break the boxers up if they become entangled in a stalemate position.

The genesis version is not to be confused with the Master System game of the same name, which is entirely different.</desc>

		<desc>2160.  Beam technology, energy shields, and ground-skimming propulsion systems have revolutionized ground combat into high-speed, wide-ranging battles. World powers like the Pacific Combine and the European League spar and vie for territory with Grav tanks, striders, and Leviathans.  Take the role of a commander overseeing one of these skirmishes and match your tactical wits with the computer or another player.

Firezone translates pen-and-paper, tactical wargaming to the computer screen.  Your primary view is a hex battle map with up to seven different types of terrain, showing stacks of infantry, artillery, armor, and command bases.    There is a structured turn sequence, with players alternating movement, fire, and retaliation.  The game stretches beyond a table-top wargame by allowing hidden units and providing a map-editor with which to create your own scenarios (nine are included).</desc>

		<desc>Tynesoft were almost certainly the first people to try a first person  pinball game with this ambitious program. Up to four players could join in, including 2 computer players to show you how it's done. The game can be played from a more traditional overhead-view mode, which makes it easier to tell where the bumpers are in relation to the flippers, and is recommended for learning the game. Most of those bumpers are single-colour and arranged in a straightforward pattern. There are three different gameplay speeds and 2 possible levels of ball bounce.</desc>

And you're a good one... with years under your belt and a multitude of successful missions behind your dark glasses. The payoff? You get a vacation, and the ultimate vacation in this business is to become a goldfish.

Yes, a goldfish. Hey, it's cushy. You swim a little, eat a little, live in a castle. (So what if it's plastic.) Just as you were getting into the vacation mode (umbrella drink and all), the tide turns. The most dangerous group of inter-dimensional anarchists surface - the Seven Deadly Fins. This septic septet will stop at nothing to destroy all forms of life as we know it. And wouldn't you know it, you are drafted to stop them!</desc>

		<name>Flight Simulator II</name>
		<desc>If there were any doubt as to the quality of Flight Simulator II, it should be dispelled by the knowledge that SubLOGIC went to the FAA for approval of its use in flight training.  Whether or not they actually got the approval—remember this was 1984, and such application of personal computers was new ground—they attempted to create a realistic flight simulator.

This flight simulator simulates a real aircraft, the Piper PA-23-181 Archer II.  For those with the knowledge, it offers practice with the variables of flight, including the avionics. The Atari ST-release (1986), instead, simulates the Cessna 182 single engine propeller aircraft and the Gates Learjet 25G twin engine jet. 

The simulator was considered to be a second generation product.  It had many more features than first generation flight simulators, and pilots were expected to pay attention to small details.  SubLOGIC encouraged the users of the game to go to flight stores and purchase flight-training manuals and aeronautical charts to help them understand the variables within the program.  The game was oriented toward pilots-in-training, but there were options for non pilots too: the company included an easy mode, and a slightly more detailed reality mode.  These modes did not require the same level of knowledge.

Flight Simulator II was also packaged with a WWI dogfighting game, called WWI Ace.  In this game your plane is armed with bombs, machine guns, and a radar screen.  The radar screen is anachronistic for a game set in World War I, but it is there to help gameplay.</desc>

		<desc>Fed up with football (soccer) management games, with all the match strategies, financial turmoil and prima donna players? This game offers a unique twist, leaving you 'managing' the career of a single player, involving matches and transfers.

You start with 10 'goal cards' - up to 3 can be played in each match, each of them giving you a shooting chance, at which point arcade action skill comes in. The better you perform, the higher your wages are, the more chance you have of a big-money transfer and international call-up, and the less chance you have of being dropped from the team.

There's also a trivia section, which asks increasingly difficult questions allowing you to go double or nothing on knowing the answers - up to £8000 a time can be won on this.</desc>

The player's ship can collect a variety of power-ups: lasers and missiles, shooting to the front, the back or the sides. Speed-ups and shields are also available. Power-ups are revealed by destroying certain enemies or special bonus capsules, and several are given to the player for free at the start of a level. The weapons can be upgraded by collecting the same power-up several times.

The player either controls the athlete in ball possession or, when in defense, the one which is nearest. When shooting, the power of the shot depends on how long the button was pressed and the direction changes with the joystick movement, e.g. moving against the walking direction results in a overhead kick.</desc>

		<desc>BACKGROUND

In Gato, you play the commander of a United States submarine in the Pacific Ocean during World War II against Japanese warships.

GAMEPLAY

Gato is a 3D real-time submarine simulation game. Gameplay consists of missions where the primary directive is to navigate your submarine to track and intercept (multiple) enemy warships (patrol boats, destroyers, etc.) on the randomly created map and close in for the kill with torpedoes.

Combat itself consists of a direct visual of enemy ships (via periscope) and firing torpedoes at the correct angle to ultimately sink the ship. Be warned that although you have the element of surprise, enemy ships can fire back! 

When all hell breaks loose, an identified submarine is a sitting duck to those Japanese guns. Be prepared to direct your damage control team to fix up your damaged submarine ASAP! The mission ends when you have successfully eliminated all targets in the map.</desc>

		<desc>Like so many other puzzle games of the time, this game involves tiles of different colours, which must be manipulated to clear a succession of increasingly-difficult levels.

The basic idea is that you are presented with 2 sets of tiles, and must make the left one identical to the 'control' set on the right. The colours are defined in a sequence - red, green, blue, purple, yellow - and when you click on a tile, that tile's colour moves forward by two in that sequence (for example a blue one becomes yellow), whereas the tiles next to it move by one colour (for example, blue becomes purple). 

Any that move past the end fo the sequence disappear, causing surrounding blocks to drop. You get a limited number of moves, and limited time as well. Fortuantely there are passwords, delivered by cutely-drawn naked Japanese girls (although the private parts are covered up).</desc>

		<desc>This must be one of the earliest team sport games to use a first-person view – the packaging mocks the Xs and Os used to represent players in contemporary Gridiron games. What you see is what the player sees – control and viewpoint passes from the kicker to the receiver on a punt or kickoff, and the quarterback to the running back or receiver on a pass or kick. Releasing passes involves rotating the controls to select the pass direction. To take the ball, aim the visible hands in the centre of the screen.

There are 28 teams split into four divisions; their names are fictional (including the Seagulls, Mustangs and Geronimos), and each is rated out of 3 on 8 areas of skill. Matches last for 4 quarters of either 4 or 7 minutes' in-play time. Menus to select plays or teams involve using diagonal movements for selection. 

Standard Gridiron rules apply – gain 10 yards in 4 attempts (downs) without fumbling or having a pass intercepted; kick a punt or field goal if you are about to fail at this.</desc>

		<name>Ghost Battle</name>
		<desc>Ghost Battle is one of the earlier games by the German company Thalion Software, who later produced such 16-bit classics as RPGs Amberstar and its sequel Ambermoon, and the platforming masterpiece Lionheart. Spanning five short yet brutally difficult worlds, the game borrows its visual style heavily from its better-known contemporaries like Shadow of the Beast and Ghosts 'n' Goblins.

A simple arcade-style action game with some rudimentary adventuring and timing based puzzles thrown in, Ghost Battle casts you as a nameless hero on a quest to rescue his, yet again, nameless girlfriend from a nameless bad guy. Enemies have a horror look and feel to them - ghouls and disembodied heads for example. Initially our hero is armed with rocks, but extra weapons can be collected for specific tasks such as the bosses who end each level.</desc>

The game is split into 8 stages, which are split into sub-stages over land and sea, each of which has a strict time limit, and a target number of planes to shoot down. They take place from behind your plane, which can be controlled with ?up' referring to ?climb' or ?dive', depending on player preference. You are armed with 10 missiles as well as standard weapons. The plane can survive a few hits, so watch the damage report as it goes from red to black. 
 
Fail to complete a section in the time limit and you use up a continue, but the amount of planes previously shot down is not reset, making the second attempt easier Chase HQ style. As you destroy enemies you gain access to better planes, and the rank reported at the end of the game improves ? this is also dependent on the skill level you play at.</desc>

Teams from various European countries are included, and you can customise these by moving players around, and changing the starting lineups and formations. An Arcade Challenge mode sees you play matches against each of the 5 computer team speeds, in succession, until you lose one - you can also arrange leagues or play individual matches.

A wide range of options are included, with variable wind settings, a range of pitches and referees, variable match lengths, and the chance to play up/down or left/right, a choice of close or distant view, and variable computer speed and skill (these can be combined to vary the game quite significantly).</desc>

The past five decades of life on the Ring-Worlds of Triton have altered the life of the Human Race. Man is no longer a warrior; his technological advancement has bred a new fighter. Robot pilots now defend his new home. With no concept of fear and reactions a little slower than the speed of light, they are the formidable force which has prevented reprisals from the pirates; until now. 
In a daring and swift surprise raid, most of these robot pilots were captured by the pirates, and are now being held on the 16 disused space research platforms on which they were forced to take refuge. The pirates are probably planning an attack on the Ring-Worlds which, now undefended, will undoubtedly fall; especially it our own robots are used against us. It is imperative that these robots are returned, or at least destroyed, otherwise the Human race will come to an end.</desc>

An alien species called "Outies" plans on transforming all suns of the galaxy into black holes. They feed off raw energy, and as black holes are a good source of that, they attempt to create as many as possible of them. The player is sent out in a scout ship to colonise worlds in an attempt to gain resources to use for battling the Outies.</desc>

		<name>Hard Drivin'</name>
		<desc>Hard Drivin' is a 3D arcade hit from Atari Games. You are in control of a high-performance sports car. Your objective is to race around the course as fast as possible and hit as many checkpoints as possible. If you hit a checkpoint you gain extra time to go farther. You will see traffic on the road both in your direction and coming down the opposite direction, so be careful when you pass... 

The course has two sections: speed track, and stunt track. Speed track is longer, but you can usually achieve higher speeds. Stunt track requires you to perform several stunts such as jumping bridges, driving through a loop, and so on. 

Crashing the car has no serious consequences and indeed shows a replay of your crash from a cinematic angle. Admire your crash head-on into the cement truck, or clipping the minivan, or flying off the bridge in the wrong angle... You lose several seconds as your car is "reset" and you get up to speed again. 

The home conversions retain most of the then-advanced 3D graphics but lack the force-feedback that was in the arcade version.</desc>

		<desc>Jump and Run game during which a little robot (named 'Heavy' respectively 'Metal') runs through five side scrolling worlds (a la Mario). Various enemies hinder progress and can be killed using an upgradable weapons system based on bouncing balls and a flamethrower. Extras and 'diamonds' can be collected from shooting or otherwise destroying rocks and walls. There are two playing modes available, one player or two players.

Extra lives will be earned depending on the number of diamonds collected. Warp Zones and hidden entrances allow access to secret zones in the levels. Each world ends with a boss monster.</desc>

		<desc>A bi-directional horizontally scrolling platform game, Hawkeye has the player in control of an SLF (Synthetic Life Form) controlled from an underground bunker by the Xamoxians. On each level, the eyes of the hawks in the status panel flash to indicate the direction to travel in to find a puzzle piece. Four pieces are needed to complete the level, but there were also other pickups such as ammo and energy. There were 12 levels to complete plus a hidden bonus level.

The player has a choice of four different weapons. The basic pistol had unlimited ammo but did little damage. The machine gun had a faster rate of fire, the laser did more damage and most powerful of all was the rocket launcher - but all three soon ran out of ammo.

The game features parallax scrolling backgrounds and large numbers of enemies (including large rhinos, triceratops and gorillas).</desc>

		<desc>In Highway Patrol II, players assume the role of a police officer trying to capture runaway felons before they reach the county border.  Players begin by choosing a target villain, with tougher ones earning a bigger bonus, and making it easier to achieve promotions. Gameplay is from the officer's viewpoint, looking through the windshield of his cruiser.

Players chase the criminals and must get them to pull over by using  intimidation (siren) or force (shotgun).  Players navigate to the criminal's whereabouts by use of the compass and map. Chasing the villain often means venturing off the road and driving through the desert. Traffic is the most obvious hazard in the game, contact with innocents cost promotion points. Other difficulties include: a flat tire, gangsters shooting back, running out of gas, or engine failure due to heat.</desc>

As a child, you spent most of your summers with your Aunt Hildegarde and Uncle Buddy. What memories! Uncle Buddy was a Hollywood big-shot, Aunt Hildegarde his loving (and very rich) wife. They had no children of their own, but you and your cousins loved their house, their parties, the Hollywood memorabilia, and them. Sure, Buddy and Hildy were a bit eccentric -- but that added to their charm. 

Aunt Hildegarde kept the house when Uncle Buddy passed away. And now that she's suddenly died, you remember her unusual will. You will inherit the entire estate -- probably worth millions if you can spend just one night in the house and on the grounds, find a treasure or two. But if you can't then you inherit nothing. 

And so Hollywood Hijinx begins with you being dropped off in front of a dark house, not to far from Hollywood ...</desc>

		<desc>RVF Honda puts you on board a realistically-modeled RC30 bike, with the task of becoming world champion. Initially you race at Clubman level on fictitious local tracks (one of which is set in MicroProse's old UK home of Tetbury), before moving up to UK and then World championship racing if you're good enough.

Each class of racing has 8 computer opponents, with the top 7 finishers in each of the championship's 8 races scoring points, and the races can be set to 5,10, 15 or 20 laps. The game's graphics appear to feature sprite-based bikes atop polygon scenery, which makes for very fast gameplay. 

The circuits feature puddles of water to upset the bike's handling, and oil, which causes you to crash. It takes time to remount the bike and get back up to speed by revving it back up (more realistic than most motorbike games at the time, but frustrating as you suffer for mistakes more), and after a couple of crashes the bike's dashboard fails, making it much harder to ride competitively.

There is a two-player null-modem link-up mode, which can support an ST racing against an Amiga if you have the right cable.</desc>

		<desc>You're one of an an elite band of soldiers pitted against an overwhelming enemy who controls most of the world. Take on various missions ranging from assassination to demolition in an effort to defeat the enemy within a time limit.

Fully 3D, you have the choice to go anywhere you please during any mission. A focus is put on freedom of choice; there's no one way to complete a mission. You can take control of any vehicle in the game, and these range from riding pedal bikes and windsurfing, to vans and ambulances, to tanks and armoured cars, to battleships and helicopters. Your arsenal includes grenades, explosives, various gadgets and a handgun, though deadlier weapons are mounted on some of the vehicles. Or if you prefer, you can acquire an enemy uniform and sneak in rather than blast your way through.

There are also many structures to be found, many containing regular citizens who may be interacted with (talking to them, bribing them...), though there are also more specialised structures which may contain vehicles, ammo, or anything you might find useful to your mission.</desc>

As with Core's previous hit Rick Dangerous 2 there is versatility in the exact structure of the game. The first four consist of the Orient, a Klondike mine, an Ice world and an Amazon forest - once these are completed the final world is open to you.

The platform-based gameplay is similar to Monty's earlier games, with primarily horizontal progresses as well as ropes and ladders to navigate. Monty has developed a useful flying kick, and has been given a smart bomb, with the potential to collect extra bombs and guns. Hazards, enemies and level designs are themed around each level, and range from cable cars and falling snowballs to Ninjas and Monkeys.</desc>

		<name>Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom</name>
		<desc>The computer versions of Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom are conversions of the Atari arcade game based on the second movie in the series. As Indy you must complete several cycles of the following 3 types of levels:Mine level: Whip your way through a mine in order to free children that are held captive. Use your whip to swing across chasms, climb ladders, ride along conveyor belts and defend yourself against attacks from Thuggee guards, bats, snakes and the fireball-throwing Mola ram. Escape with the mine cart after you've freed all children.
2. Mine cart level: Pick the right route through a network of tracks while riding in a mine cart. Avoid potholes, broken tracks &amp; guards in carts and safely reach the end of the track.
3. Temple level: Make your way to the altar and grab the Sankara stone while Mola Ram, bats and Thuggee guards attack you. Watch out for that lava.
With every cycle the mine &amp; mine cart levels become more complex, the layout of the temple levels is always the same. After several cycles there's a showdown with Mola Ram on the rope bridge.</desc>

The game is viewed in 3D from Solar's perspective, with a full HUD built into his helmet showing direction, health and supplies. Other HUDs also allow you to check whether the current air is breathable (you have limited oxygen), as well as one built into your Jetpack.

There are two movement modes, one of which allows you to pan the view and the other allows you to shoot. Objects have to be picked up and used, computers operated, and an infra-red kit located and used. To win the game you will have to destroy all the eggs, and then shut the compound down and escape in time.</desc>

The major difference is the visual perspective, which is in pure 3D, viewed just behind the ball as you move up the pitch, with full polygons and some shading. You have a radar on screen to allow you to see where your team-mates are, which reduces the disadvantage of not being able to look behind you.

Two tournaments are featured - a superleague and a recreated World Cup, as well as practice modes. By moving the joystick as you shoot, you can adjust the direction and height of a pass or shot, allowing for a wide range of moves.</desc>

		<desc>Dreams are made by The Dreamtrack Corporation, a group of evil subliminal-messengers whose intention is to destroy the minds of the minority of people capable of interpreting other people's dreams and live them out through entertainment. That's the story in this distinctly Cyberpunk-inspired title, and you play Chad, the man who discovers this secret, and aims to put an end to it.

Your task on each level is to clear a path for Kaf-E, your girlfriend, to be able to progress to the heart of the Dreamtrack HQ, getting past each of the myriad of security systems they have built up. A map must be used to navigate the route through the systems, with lots of information readily available.

The basic gameplay sees you darting through 3D tunnels using the mouse, and is like a prototype Descent, with your ship kitted out with cannons and missiles, with each enemy better dealt with by one or the other.

As well as ensuring your own survival, you must guide Kaf-E through the levels by blasting out the correct sections to clear a path for her. As she has no intelligence, and simply walks into walls, this element can be compared to Lemmings.</desc>

Three Allied soldiers have been captured, and you must infiltrate the facilities, rescue your brave comrades, destroy the building, and salvage as much of the stolen art treasures as possible.

There are eight levels to explore, each with a specific mission objective. Some of the paintings are loose, others are in crates which must first be shot. Explosives must be collected, not shot. With limited ammunition, guards everywhere, keys at a premium, and lots of strategic hiding points, an all-guns-blazing approach is less successful than a planned, measured one.</desc>

Invest is all about, well, investment - fresh cash flows directly into new businesses, new shares and new company improvements in a never-ending cycle of productivity.

Up to four human players can compete for market dominance; the computer takes vacant places. Whoever amasses the most money or builds a monopoly in one of the six business areas (from pharmaceuticals to space engineering) wins. Tension rises as hired saboteurs and spies infiltrate companies to cause maximum damage - unless they are caught by a detective on guard.

In your quest you will encounter Mutant Appendages that will drag you into the murky depths of the swamp; fences, walls, barriers, and traps which you must avoid; primitive natives, and wild animals; police vehicles and Urban Warriors who will stop at nothing to catch and kill you.

The game is third-person racing action arcade, where the player controls a Quad and shoots the enemies with the weapon chosen for it.

Gameplay is available for one or two players. In two players mode the screen is split on two sides, and each player may play in cooperative or competitive mode.</desc>

You are in the role of the Grand Vizier Iznogoud, whose only thought is to depose the Caliph of magical Baghdad and become "Caliph instead of the Caliph!"  To accomplish this aim, you must wander around and interact with characters around you, acquiring objects along the way that may or may not be useful, and figure out how all this will help you achieve your goal.

During the game, you have 4 different methods of interacting with other characters: you can give objects to them, you can threaten them, you can flatter them, and you can throw a tantrum.  Depending on the character, these actions will elicit different responses--or none altogether.  You will need objects for various things, and objects are all acquired from other characters.  Some characters are helpful, others are not.  But the right combination of your actions will help you to become Caliph instead of the Caliph, while the wrong ones will often land you in a cell beneath the palace.

The game now features full tournament modes (although the players on the teams are fictitious) and four different pitches (including an implementation of plastic pitches, whose uneven bounce cause controversy when several British clubs tried them in the 1980s).

Viewed top-down, the controls involve trapping the ball under your foot, giving you time to prepare passes. Running with the ball is tricky at first, as it doesn't stick to your foot the way it did in contemporary football games. Complex moves such as overhead kicks, back-heels and long-range through-ball passes can be completed with practice.</desc>

The three leagues (Elite, Major and Minor) will differ by the level of brutality. The action takes place in a circular rink. Each team of five players should put the iron ball in the small hole of the opposite team to make a score, and do not allow the players of another team to make the same. Each team player has health indicator, which will decrease during the game, because the only way to take the ball is to knock down the opponent in any brutal way. Each match during the season has time limit, but it may be finished also if all the players of any team will be unconscious and at least one ball will be put in the hole.

The game has a training mode, where you may play a single match with a computer or another human player, and tournament mode, where eight teams controlled either by computer or human players will fight for the victory. Tournament progress may be saved and restored.</desc>

You have been chosen to be the central link of the support command which will try to give a solution for it. But don't worry, you have been educated and trained in the Golden Ring space station, the hardest survival school of the galactic confederation.

Besides, your ship is equipped with the ultimate devices which will allow you to travel safely by the well-known universe. The Combat Mode, where you can activate a panel with a system to locate and to destroy your enemies and the Control System via Menus, both make La Aventura Espacial a new concept in the graphic-conversational adventure.

First of all, your mission is to find your companions, whom are distributed by all the universe, and together with them you must arrive to the central base of the Dark Threat. There, you will have to deal one on one with the computer. It's not an easy task, but you are the last hope of the humanity. All the galaxy has its destiny in your hands.</desc>

The adventure is developed in the island of Cozumel, where you must guide an archaeologist who had an incident. He was sailing towards it perfectly equipped, when an unfortunate shipwreck left him without anything. Do not think he only lost the map or the machete, no, he lost everything, including the trousers and the underclothes, reason why it's quite possible that an entrance in San Marcos, coastal town near the place of the shipwreck, would carry serious problems with the justice. The main mission of the adventure is to discover all the hidden secrets of the island and then be able to escape from it.

This game uses the habitual commands of the previous AD adventures, plus the inclusion of some PSI characters, it means, personages with own personality, decision capacity, different behavior according to the development of the adventure, that is, personages who must be treated as if they were real since their reactions can vary from a game to another. Some improvements like the objects treatment system have been incorporated (which include all their qualities); a better graphical detail; a score system that it indicates you which actions are positive and which negative, etc.</desc>

But the things were even worse: in addition to six years of imprisonment he lost his lovely wife, Mylène. 

Who was involved in this affair? To discover the truth, you as Raymond should perform your own investigation in seven European cities: Barcelona, Paris, Cannes, Rome, Amsterdam, Hamburg and London. In turns you'll behave as a gangster or as a journalist. It is up to you to perform the investigation in cold blood despite the lies and hired assassins. Someone must pay!

The gameplay flows as adventure in first-person view. You choose the place to visit and examine the objects there. Moving the cursor on the scene, you set its part in focus and may interact with it. Some of the objects may be added to your inventory and used later, some of the persons may share a valuable information with you, some of them may be hostile.

The game supports several languages: French, German, English, Italian, Dutch, and Spanish.</desc>

		<name>Laser Squad</name>
		<desc>Laser Squad is by the same designer as Microprose's classic X-Com: UFO Defense. It brings to the table an immersive gameplay environment as well as many innovative ideas that weren't available in any other game of the time.

In Laser Squad you control a group of "marine"-like soldiers (and the occasional cyborg). Before taking them into battle, you must buy them weapons and armour with a predetermined amount of credits, taking into account the individual abilities of your squad. Unlike X-COM, the soldiers do not gain experience over time.

There are 3 missions in turn - in The Assassins you must face down Sterner Regnix and his guards, Moonbase assault challenges you to destroy the OmniCorp database, and Rescue From the Mines eschews violence in favour of a rescue mission. These are viewed from above and progress in turns. Laser Squad also features a 2-player "hotseat"-type gaming option.</desc>

		<desc>A squad of four tough-guy soldiers have to take out some foes in a jungle. As the game starts, four soldiers are depicted, with any who are not present to play killed immediately - a joystick adaptor is required for 3 or 4 player games.

Leatherneck resembles Ikari Warriors - waves of soldiers move down the screen shooting at you, and you must shoot them before the bullets make contact. You are armed with grenades to take out mounted turrets, or kill a wide range of enemies at once, but watch out for enemy grenades. There are extra ammunition crates and improved weapons to pick up - waggle the joystick to toggle which one you are using.

Unusually, your shots are long-range and take effect instantly. You cannot change the direction you are facing, instead having the ability to strafe.</desc>

		<desc>Leisure Suit Larry in the Land of the Lounge Lizards is the first game in Al Lowe's Leisure Suit Larry series, largely inspired by the text adventure Softporn Adventure.

Larry, the game's protagonist, is a short, tacky, balding, leisure suit-wearing kinda guy who's constantly searching for his next score. His combination of stupidity and brashness gets Larry into trouble. The object is to get him out of trouble in traditional adventure fashion, finding and manipulating objects as you thread your way through the story line. The content is comedic and adult-oriented. A graphical interface is used with a text parser to input commands. Typical of Sierra games, progress is tracked through a set amount of points, awarded for advancement or minor actions.</desc>

		<desc>Life &amp; Death is a game which casts you as a doctor in a hospital. Your job is to diagnose patients and administer appropriate therapies, or even perform surgery when necessary. 

To diagnose a patient, you have to press on his or her abdomen, to see which portions of the stomach cause pain. Basing on this knowledge, you can choose a therapy for him (observation, medication or referring to another specialist) or administer a X-Ray or ultrasound scan to get more information about his illness. 

In some cases, surgery will be necessary. You're the surgeon and you have to perform the operation very carefully, adhering strictly to the procedures, preserving hygiene, and maintaining care when cutting up the patient. 

Should you mistakenly administer the wrong therapy, or kill your patient at the operating table, you're kicked into the medical school, where you're given hints as to what you've done wrong.</desc>

The Empire has sent robotic guards down to protect the gold, and contact with any of these will cost you a life. Your method of escaping them is to press fire to dig a hole in their line of movement, thus causing them to fall in briefly, allowing you to move across the gap safely. Once all the gold has been collected, a ladder allowing you to move onto the next screen is added. Completing these screens often requires forward planning and precision.

		<desc>Loom is an adventure game from LucasFilm. What sets Loom apart from other adventure games (in direct comparison with Sierra's) is its unique interface: you do not carry items around, but rather manipulate existing items through the use of spells. The spells themselves are woven through playing magical notes on a special distaff. Loom also features three difficultly levels, and differentiates them by changing the way the interface works: Standard features the distaff at the bottom of the screen but notes aren't written, whereas Expert doesn't have the distaff and you have to replay the spells by hearing alone.

In Loom you play the role of Bobbin Threadbare, a young man from the Guild of Weavers who just turned 17. Although you do not know why, you are outcast from the guild and blamed for the lack of prosperity in recent times.
After the Council of Elders is attacked and the Elders are turned into swans, you as Bobbin must set forth on a journey to find the swans and try to restore order to the Guild of Weavers.</desc>

		<name>Loopz</name>
		<desc>A puzzle game where the main goal is to make loops! Random pieces are presented over a board, including simple lines and corners as well as S bends and other warped shapes, of varying sizes. It is up to the player to link them up in a loop form, then moving on to the next level. Pieces can be placed on any empty space on the grid, and rotated into one of the four main compass directions.

Any pieces which are not part of the finished loop when a level is completed are left on the screen, so there is value in playing towards 2 distinct loops, to ensure that you have options depending on which pieces are drawn - unlike Pipe Dream there are no clues as to which pieces are coming next.

Three play modes are available, two of which can be played with two players. Game A is freestyle - simply make loops, gaining extra points for size and style. 

Game B is about unlocking bonus boards of the game by reaching a certain score. and uses a bonus multiplier method depending on loop difficulty.

The third mode of play begins with an already made loop and then removes random pieces of it, so the player has to put them back in when they appear again. It is essentially a memory test and logic puzzle of fitting the pieces back as one remembers - although placing a piece where it seems to fit is also often effective.</desc>

		<desc>Lords of Conquest is influenced by the boardgame Risk. You and your opponent start by selecting countries in turn from a map. This can be randomly generated based on requested numbers of countries and volumes of water, chosen from one of the 19 predefined ones, or created using the inbuilt editor.

Your army possesses infantry, cavalry and a water fleet. Natural or produced resources such as gold and iron are identified - countries containing these might be the best ones to invade.You can play at 4 skill levels, and decide how big a factor luck is. With calculations settled by the computer, players can concentrate on the power games.</desc>

		<name>Lotus Esprit Turbo Challenge</name>
		<desc>The first in a series of 3 racing games endorsed by the legendary car company, which is now a part of Proton.

The game features a total of 32 fictitious racetracks from around the world, split into 3 difficulty levels. There are 19 computer opponents (15 on the 8-bit versions) and you have to finish in the top 10 (top 8 on the 8-bits) to progress. The higher you finish in one race, the lower down the grid you start for the next race. The opposition drivers have pun names based on the F1 drivers of the day - examples include Ricardo Pastry and Crashhard Banger.

You can choose between sound effects or one of a variety of music pieces. The game features a simultaneous 2-player mode, but the 1-player mode only uses half the screen, a simple animation filling the other half. In most races you will have to make a pitstop for fuel in order to reach the finish. The tracks include features such as oil slicks, roadworks, boulders and rivers - contact with these (or the other cars) will slow you, but there is no car damage model.</desc>

There are 13 different types of races, ranging from Motorways to night-time to sections punctuated by roadworks, and some are lap-based with others being simple A-B. 2 players could play on a split screen mode. 
 
The game's crowning glory, however, was the RECS editor, which allowed you to create courses of your own, with theoretically millions possible.</desc>

		<name>Lotus Turbo Challenge II</name>
		<desc>This sequel to Lotus Esprit Turbo Challenge is again a behind-the-car viewed racing game. It takes in eight distinct circuits, adding surface and weather effects such as desert and snow. Later in the game, you must race through two-way motorways with oncoming traffic, (incorporating civilian cars and trucks), and face tough levels aided by speed and time boost pick-ups.

You are no longer racing directly against other cars or over laps; instead, racing is on time as you have limited time to reach each checkpoint.  Reaching each of these extends your time, and any remaining time is turned into bonus points if you successfully complete the track.

You have two cars at your disposal, which the game chooses automatically for each level, hence the loss of the word 'Esprit' from the title. The Lotus Esprit form the original is joined by a Lotus Elan convertible, which is slower but has better grip. 

You can play through the set of tracks either full-screen or in split-screen mode with another player. On Amiga and ST the game allows you to link two machines, each of which can have two human players. If one player successfully completes one of the 8 courses, all players can continue onto the next one.</desc>

		<name>Lucky Luke</name>
		<desc>This multi-genre game is based on the famous comics series about Lucky Luke, a good cowboy who draws his gun and shoots quicker than his shadow.

It was decided to construct a railway line to connect the East and West of the United States. Two companies argued about the establishment of this line. You were chosen to protect the quality of the line and to do not give it away to the competitor.

In the beginning, Lucky Luke should move around the town and find out the bandits preventing him from travel on the train. During arcade shooting he should shoot all of them on the streets and inside the saloon.

After train stops in front of the boulder on the rails, Lucky Luke has to find the way to this boulder to blow it up with a bomb collecting the useful items and using them in adventure mode. During these actions he'll encounter four Daltons and Apache's leader.

The next trial is a puzzle, where Lucky Luke has to connect the branch lines for the train switching the points on the railway.

And the last one is to solve the problem of water between Comanches and the Ranch owners in the place where quality will be checked finally.</desc>

You fly through a set of tunnels presented in a mixture of vectors and solid 3D, with arrows guiding you as to which way to go. The ship's damage is split into ten areas, and the auto-repair feature can be set to prioritise these. Energy resources are limited, and must be allocated across different areas of the ship.

Accurate steering and shooting are not enough – puzzles protect the route, and these will take some pondering. You are armed with multiple weapons (types of lasers, mines, a rear-gunning-droid and various guiding missiles), each of which has its own use. You also have an on-board map and radar, as well as a turbo facility.</desc>

During your journey, you will travel through four huge worlds where you will blow out a variety of enemies. But this game isn't yet another mindless shoot'em up -- there are a lot of clever surprises awaiting you too.

You can give more damage if you press the fire key longer. Further, your weapon changes its shape and features according to the requirements of each world.

One of the best features of Magic Pockets is the incredible athletic capabilities of the Bitmap Kid. You can jump really high by stepping on your whirlwinds, and can even destroy all the creatures you hit after falling down from a high place. These are no special features -- they are all your "normal" capabilities. In addition, you can drive a bike, dive, and even fly when you get special items.

There is even a story that a meteorite once crashed near the home nearly 20 years ago. More immediately, a girl named Sandy has gone missing from the local highschool and her boyfriend Dave swears that he saw Dr. Fred abducting her. Dave knows that he cannot do it alone and will need help from two other students if he has any hope of infiltrating the mansion and rescuing Sandy.

Players start by choosing 2 students to accompany Dave to the Edison mansion, and can then switch between these three characters at will. Most actions are carried out by selecting verbs on the screen and applying them to an object (such as "OPEN Door"). Each character maintains a separate personality and may have a different way to solve a problem from his classmates. Thus many of the puzzles can be overcome in different ways depending on the character being used. If any one of the kids are captured by the Edisons, they are thrown into the dungeon and must be rescued themselves by any character who still has their freedom.</desc>

If any one of the kids are captured by the Edisons, they are thrown into the dungeon and must be rescued themselves by any character who still has their freedom.</desc>

		<name>Maniac Mansion</name>
		<desc>The Edison mansion has always been a creepy old house on the edge of town. There have been rumors of strange experiments going on and of odd creatures living amongst the Edison family. There is even a story that a meteorite once crashed near the home nearly 20 years ago. More immediately, a girl named Sandy has gone missing from the local highschool and her boyfriend Dave swears that he saw Dr. Fred abducting her. Dave knows that he cannot do it alone and will need help from two other students if he has any hope of infiltrating the mansion and rescuing Sandy.

Players start by choosing 2 students to accompany Dave to the Edison mansion, and can then switch between these three characters at will. Most actions are carried out by selecting verbs on the screen and applying them to an object (such as "OPEN Door"). Each character maintains a separate personality and may have a different way to solve a problem from his classmates. Thus many of the puzzles can be overcome in different ways depending on the character being used. If any one of the kids are captured by the Edisons, they are thrown into the dungeon and must be rescued themselves by any character who still has their freedom.</desc>

		<desc>Masterblazer is both a remake of and a follow-up to the Lucasfilm Games classic Ballblazer.

Ballblazer is a futuristic sport played in vehicles called "Rotofoils". The play field is a large rectangle made out of squares. The object of the game is to get a ball called "Plasmorb" into the goal, which moves along the edge of the play field. Otherwise, the rules are simple : "Three minutes, two players, one victor!"

The game is played in first-person on a split screen and can be played by either one or two players.

In addition to the original Ballblazer game, Masterblazer offers two new playing options: a Tournament Mode and a Rotofoil Race.</desc>

		<desc>Metal Mutant is an action game, where you control the eponymous machine, sent to the planet Kronox to find and destroy the insane computer AROD 7. Each level is not side-scrolling fluidly, but is divided into separate screens; upon getting to the edge of one screen you move to the next one. 

The Metal Mutant has the ability to transform into 3 different forms: humanoid, dinosaur and tank. Each form has different capabilities. For instance, the humanoid form can jump and the tank can shoot missiles. You'll need to change form often depending on the situation, as most obstacles and enemies can be only beaten by a specific form. 

Throughout the game, apart from fighting enemies (and bosses), jumping, climbing and so on, you will find additional upgrades which will give you more abilities. You'll also encounter recharge station where you can regain health.</desc>

		<desc>Midi-Maze, played on Atari STs linked up via MIDI cables, is probably the first multiplayer first-person shooter for home micros, and a descendent of the original Maze War from the 70s.

Naturally, this game is quite dissimilar to the FPS games of today. The game is set in a typical maze with only 90° corners instead of the multi-level free layouts of a modern FPS, and all graphics are drawn with filled polygons only. Weapon systems are limited to a plain gun with a small reloading interval. And all the participants are big, floating smiling faces. Up to 16 players may compete simultaneously, but those who wish to train before a match can do it alone against drones. It is possible both to play one against all or to team up.</desc>

		<desc>A bomb has been set by terrorists to blow up a sky-scraping hotel in which the FBI’s Central Intelligence Unit is located, and you must diffuse it. 
Reaching the room itself is no easy task, as the hotel is split into segments of 8 floors, and you can’t move onto the next one without the emergency key, which the porter has hold of – he must be located. Each of these has one eighth of the secret stop code, and these must be entered in order to finally diffuse the bomb. Secrets can be gleaned from the opposing hijackers, and from the barman. In some cases furniture can be used to your advantage. 
The whole game is similar to Impossible Mission, requiring lots of logic, puzzle-solving and structured thought.</desc>

		<desc>'Nam 1965-1975 is a strategy game set during the Vietnam war. The player takes the role of both the President of the United States and the commander-in-chief, and the goal of the game is to prevent the South of Vietnam to fall in the hands of the Vietcong, managing its military resources and preventing the public opinion to reject the war. As President, the player has to manage the military resources, and as Commander in chief they can take direct decisions on the terrain, such as tactics or engaging enemies.  
 
The game offers five different scenarios: Khe Sanh, Tet Offensive, 1975 offensive, Nixon and Johnson. The first three are some of the most decisive battles during the conflict, whereas choosing "Nixon" or "Johnson" changes the year (1964 or 1968) in which the player starts playing.</desc>

		<name>Narc</name>
		<desc>Narc is a 1-2 player game, where your mission is to infiltrate the Mr. Big Corporation, the scourge of the underworld. To do this, you must get through the game's eight stages, with over ten sectors like the junkyard, subway, drug lab, nursery, downtown, Sunset Strip, and even the corporation, where Mr. Big resides. In order to get through the stages, you are required to collect a number of safe cards, and insert them in the slot next to the stage exit.  Each sector includes a map, and should be easy to read. For example, the blue or red dots represent you, and the white dots are the missile launchers, while the "E" indicates the exit.

Your mission ain't going to be easy, as you will come face-to-face with enemies including the canine mutts, Das Lof Gang, Dr. Spike Rush, Joe Rockhead, Kinky Pinky, Sgt. Skyhigh, HQ Posse, and Mr. Big himself. You have two ways you can deal with them: either put a bullet in them or make arrests. Furthermore, they will try to blow you up the minute they see you. Fortunately, you're armed with a shotgun and missile launcher, but these both have a limited supply of ammunition. If your bullet counter reaches one, you can only fire one bullet at a time, so you need to find some more. Also, it is important not to waste all of your missiles: you might need them later when you deal with later enemies like Mr. Big. You are also backed up by a chopper and a mean shiny street machine.

More often than not, when you blow up enemies, you can pick up several items that they drop, including drugs, money, ammunition, missile launchers, and if you're lucky, safe cards.  Even if you got the safe card and can pass the level, you can keep blowing up enemies to score more points. According to the game, this game is for training purposes only, so you will not get employed by your local DEA office. Is this what the DEA does every day: go on rampages?</desc>

The game begins with you as Prince Corwin forced to compete against your eight scheming noble brothers and sisters for the throne of Amber at the center of the one true world. Corwin must travel across the dimensions to this fascinating realm and from there rally forces against those who would oppose him. Unfortunately, things do not always proceed as planned.

When you wake up, you know little of this, as you have been knocked unconscious and pummeled with drugs. All you have is the address of your scheming sister.

The game is largely based around interaction with other characters, and can end in 40 different ways depending on how these work.</desc>

		<name>Nitro</name>
		<desc>A racing game in which four cars - up to three of them can be controlled by players - complete for the first place in over 20 levels.

These levels are divided into four themes, and a few of them are played at night: Although it's hard enough to tell which way to go in the eight-way-scrolling maps during the day, you're sure to hit many barriers and walls at night when only your headlights give you any clues about where to go.

Depending on how well you raced, you'll get money to upgrade your car - and you'll also need to refuel your car! There are three types of cars to choose from, and depending on what kind of terrain a level is on, making the right choice here can give you the edge.</desc>

		<name>No Second Prize</name>
		<desc>There is indeed no second prize in this race between 6 of the world’s toughest riders. First prize is the one remaining model of the greatest motorbike the world has ever seen, incidentally.

The graphics are polygon based, with lots of roadside detail, and leaning into corners to maximise turn-in leads to the graphics to tilt appropriately. The control is mouse-based, allowing for slight adjustments to be made and ensuring that the controls are realistic but not impossible. As well as your five rivals, there are lots of Sunday riders on the roads, distinguished by having brown bikes, so make sure to avoid these.

This was one of the first games to feature video-style replays, allowing you to find the exact moment you want to replay, from any part of the race, and view it at normal speed, double-speed, or freeze-frame. The camera angles on offer here include one that follows the bike, one that views the track from the side, and a TV-style chase view.</desc>

		<name>Oids</name>
		<desc>Oids may be described as a cross between the classic arcade games Gravitar and Choplifter including a game editor for creating your own planetoids and galaxies.

You control a V-Wing fighter on many different planetoids to rescue and free a race of android slaves, the "Oids" of the game's title. The spacecraft controls are similar to a lunar-lander. Turn and thrust because gravity is always pulling at your ship. If your ship crashes into a mountain or any other obstruction on the ground, it will explode.

To survive against the various defenses on the planetoids (enemy spaceships, rockets and more) your ship is equipped with two different weapons and an energy shield. Flying around and using the energy shield costs fuel. You can refuel by landing next to a fuel base.

The main objective on each of your missions is to rescue all the Oids on each planetoid in the galaxy. To rescue the Oids, you must first destroy the factories in which they are held captive. Use only single shoots to avoid killing the Oids. Once you have blasted a factory open, the Oids will run out and wave to you. Find a flat surface nearby and land your ship. Once eight Oids have climbed aboard, or you have rescued all the Oids on the planetoid, it's time to dock with your mother-ship to complete your rescue mission.</desc>

		<desc>You control a black orb that is trapped in a puzzle like labyrinth.  A level is called a landscape and there are 200 landscapes to solve. The main gameplay element consists of opening the so-called oxydstones. You can bump against a oxydstone and a colored symbol will appear. Uncover two of the same colors and they will stay open, making it a memory-like game. Open all oxydstones to solve a landscape.

To make things more interesting there are walls, pitfalls, quicksand, one-way walls, breakable tiles, reflecting lasers (for Deflektor-like puzzle solving), movable blocks (for Sokoban-like puzzle solving), tiles that crumble away when roll over them, doors, switches etc. Some of the landscapes contain items that you can pick up and use. Items include pieces of paper with hints, umbrellas that give you the ability to float, bombs to blow up walls, a spring to jump across gaps.

To mix up the gameplay, every tenth landscape is a meditation landscape where you simultaneously control several green orbs. Manoeuvre each of the orbs into a pit to solve these landscapes.</desc>

There are sixteen rounds to complete, with four trips each. During each round, he can grab a power pellet, which cause ghosts to turn blue, allowing Pac-Man to eat them for points. Points are also awarded by collecting fruit that appear, like cherries and strawberries. In some rounds, Pac must use a springboard to jump over a lake. He must also make it to the end of each round before time runs out, otherwise a ghost will chase him.</desc>

		<desc>Pang is a platform game which consists of 50 levels in total. It can be played with one or two players on the same screen, and the other player can join anytime within the game. 

Your goal is to destroy the balloons which bounce around the playfield. To accomplish this, you can shoot hooks which travel upwards, and blow up any balloon they touch. Depending on their size, they either split on two smaller ones, or evaporate if they're at their minimum size. Apart from balloons, some levels also have barriers that have to be destroyed with your hooks, since they often block your access to balloons. There are also some barriers which cannot ever be destroyed. Your character has the ability to climb ladders, but cannot jump. 

You can also pick up power-ups such as: the ability to fire two shots at once, the hook that attaches to the ceiling and waits 'til something bumps into it, a gun which has a high rate of fire but cannot destroy barriers. Beside extra weapons, you can also pick certain things like clock (halting time for a small period), dynamite (reducing all balls to minimum size, thus making you able to reach more points), life, and such.</desc>

Depending on their size, they either split on two smaller ones, or evaporate if they're at their minimum size. Apart from balloons, some levels also have barriers that have to be destroyed with your hooks, since they often block your access to balloons. There are also some barriers which cannot ever be destroyed. Your character has the ability to climb ladders, but cannot jump. 

You can also pick up power-ups such as: the ability to fire two shots at once, the hook that attaches to the ceiling and waits 'til something bumps into it, a gun which has a high rate of fire but cannot destroy barriers. Beside extra weapons, you can also pick certain things like clock (halting time for a small period), dynamite (reducing all balls to minimum size, thus making you able to reach more points), life, and such.</desc>

		<name>Peter Beardsley's International Football</name>
		<desc>Licensed around former England player Peter Beardsley, this football (soccer) game is viewed side-on. The only playing option is the European Championship tournament of the day, although you can choose the 8 teams from the 26 major European footballing nations of the time (so the USSR, Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia are all still complete). Two players can compete in these groups, but there's no guarantee of getting straight to a 2-player game, especially as tournaments (and individual matches) can't be quit out of.

The gameplay features variable strength kicks, determined by how long you hold the fire button for. In a break with realistic physics, the ball ricochets back in the direction it came from. Goalkeepers stay on the goal-line rather than using the whole penalty box.</desc>

This game lets you choose from 6 different "ages" (for example, "The Silver Empire" from 1560-1600, "War For Profit" from 1640-1660, etc.), one of 4 nationalities (English, French, Dutch, Spanish), 4 difficulty levels, and one of 5 special abilities (skill at fencing, skill at navigation, etc.). Nine different types of ships were represented. 

The goal of the game is to retire with as much gold and land as possible, as many ranks/titles as possible (Colonel, Admiral, Marquis, Duke), and a wife. Finding long lost relatives helps too. You accomplish these goals by plundering cities, capturing and sinking enemy ships, getting in good with governors to receive titles, learn news of "evil Spaniards" holding your relatives, capturing evil pirates, etc.

		<desc>Plutos is a vertically-scrolling shoot 'em up featuring a succession of waves, containing what's reputed to be the first simultaneous 2-player mode on the ST or Amiga. Many of the enemies you face are waves of laser fodder with movement patterns taking them around the screen, with gun turrets and firing enemies as well, to fight or avoid. You start with 4 lives, and get an extra one (and a 5000 point bonus) after every level.

In many similar shoot 'em ups, you have unlimited fuel but must pick up ammunition recharges or increased powerups. Plutos lacks weapon upgrades, but rather inventively forces you to refuel, by shooting at posts which contain fuel (there are also bays for 500 bonus points marked out). Each level finishes with an enemy with eyes shooting at you, and from level 3 there are teeth mounted in front which fire at you.</desc>

		<desc>Strange happenings are afoot once again in Sweethaven and only Popeye can make it right. In Popeye 2, our spinach lovin' hero must once again rescue Olive Oyl and make mincemeat of Bluto while looking after Swee'Pea, feeding Wimpy and keeping an eye on Jeep.

Popeye has four different levels to traverse through. His initial adventure takes him to a construction site where bouncing springs, falling girders and open welding flames impede his progress. Rolling barrels, and bombs which must be touched to be put out also stand to cause harm. In every level scattered hamburgers must be collected in order for Popeye to get past Wimpy who is often hanging out somewhere near the top of every vertically scrolling platform level. There are also feats of strength that Popeye must perform by beating up a punching robot-type thing with the aid of Spinach. Once past all these obstacles Popeye can move on to the next level.

The second level takes Popeye into the urban jungle where he must climb the side of the Biff Spinach building and avoid the same obstacles as in the previous levels. In the third level falling girders are replaced with giant bananas as Popeye finds himself in a jungle. Coconut throwing monkeys hang from ledges and snoozing tigers and snakes decorate the trees. The fourth and final level of the game finds Popeye climbing the masts of the S.S. Trev and the S.S. Andy as he makes his way to a final confrontation with Bluto and rescue Olive Oyl.

Popeye is able to jump around and occasionally when the situation calls for it punch his way through this vertical platformer. Bonus points are rewarded for finding Swee'Pea and Jeep. He can take multiple hits before he takes a curtain call but thankfully is unharmed by long drops. The player should beware as Popeye has only one life to get through the four levels of this adventure.</desc>

		<name>Populous</name>
		<desc>You play a god, gaming against other gods in a celestial game of conquest.  To win, you must help your chosen people take over the world and wipe out the vermin who worship that other god.

Each god starts out with a single human, dumped into the middle of the wilderness.  Sometimes there is inhabitable land in sight, sometimes not.  To get win, you must change the landscape, creating flat land for your followers to build on.  The more followers you have you have, the more powerful you will be, so take care of them. Build as fast as you can, because the other god is doing the same.

When you have enough followers, you can make the leader of your people into a hero.  He will then go around the land you have built, literally taking strength from the people into himself, and working his way toward the enemy.  When he gets there, he will engage in holy warfare upon your enemy's people.  He will burn; he will kill.  And he won't stop until they're all dead... or he is.

But you don't have to let your people have all the fun; the god's have other tools as well.  You can drown your enemies one at a time with your land lowering powers.  Submerge their towns in swamps. Raise a volcano in the middle of their best farmland.  Even better, you can flood the land and drain all the people who didn't build on high-ground. 

And when you win, you'll have 500 more worlds to conquer.  A god's play is just never done.</desc>

		<desc>The Powerdrome racing series is now into its 24th year of high-speed high-octane action. Why race on flat 2D circuits when you can charge through a multi-textured half-pipe in small aircraft? Typhoon Racing have taken up the challenge, and entered you in their machine.

There are 6 different circuits, with hazards including chicanes, tunnels and crusher gates. Shading to the sections marks out whether a corner or dive is coming up. There are 5 computer opponents to race against in one player mode, while a data link cable allows 2-player games.

		<desc>The Powerdrome racing series is now into its 24th year of high-speed high-octane action. Why race on flat 2D circuits when you can charge through a multi-textured half-pipe in small aircraft? Typhoon Racing have taken up the challenge, and entered you in their machine.

There are 6 different circuits, with hazards including chicanes, tunnels and crusher gates. Shading to the sections marks out whether a corner or dive is coming up. There are 5 computer opponents to race against in one player mode, while a data link cable allows 2-player games.

		<name>Pro Powerboat Simulator</name>
		<desc>If this 'simulator' is to be believed, powerboat racing is a chaotic race across a number of largely one-directional tracks with fjords and inlets forcing you down one of two lanes, and sections where a bridge needs to be cleared by hitting a ramp at the right speed beforehand (as you jump over these, you can land so as to skim off other boats). Your boat is fitted with bombs, which can be placed so as to force the other boats to run over them, gaining you points. Extra bombs and fuel litter the course, often close to the banks, which you must avoid contact with, for fear of crashing your boat. When this happens you are forced into the next one, which is, as if by magic, available at a convenient point just beforehand. A helicopter flies overhead, dropping bombs which you must avoid, and often obscuring your view. The other boats often crowd together attempting to force you into the wall.

As with all the Codemasters budget titles, realism goes out of the window, with an emphasis on simple instantaneous action.</desc>

The gameplay is simple: you're facing a row of buildings, a gangster pops up and you have to shoot him before the on-screen timer goes empty and he shoots you first. You can hide until the timer restarts but this is limited too. 
At the end of each stage is a bonus round where you have to shoot gangsters in a room, with no more ability to hide and a faster timer.
As you progress through each stage, the game will become faster, and enemies will become harder to find and to hit.
Of course, your goal is to reach the end of the game with the highest possible score.</desc>

		<name>Projectyle</name>
		<desc>Projectyle is a single or multiplayer (1 to 3 players) hockey-type sports game of the future. It features smooth-scrolling, frantic action, colorful graphics and digital music.

A total of five goal rooms, arranged in the shape of a cross, are connected with tunnels. The camera smoothly follows the puck/ball (the "projectyle") and scrolls to the adjacent rooms when entering one of the connecting tunnels. Each player, whether computer-controlled or not, has a room in which his own goal is located (their "defense" zone.) A fourth room -- the Frantic Zone -- contains a goalmouth for each player, while the central room, where action begins, allows access to the four other rooms.

The object of the game is for each player to protect their own goal while trying to bring the puck/ball into the other players' rooms to score a goal. Bonuses appear randomly in the rooms, allowing the player who passes on them to gain some benefits, such as freezing the other players for a few seconds, gaining extra stamina, or sealing exits.

The game supports up to 3 player simultaneous quick action single game play, and can support up to 8 players in leagues of varying lengths.  League/tournament play supports player/team management, including training, injuries and position reassignment.</desc>

A set of jewels has been stolen. At the time of the theft, a curator was with the jewels, so he got stolen, too. And who's the suspect? Norman Bates, of course. The next night, a daring detective drives out to the sinister Bates Motel. His plan: a) find the jewels, b) free the curator and c) take a nice hot shower, should time suffice.

Psycho is entirely controlled with the keyboard: direction keys for moving your character around, shortcut keys for performing actions. You need to stand close to an interesting object in order to examine it. Adversaries will appear at random throughout the house, putting you to sleep by touch and thus draining your precious time -- you've only got four hours to solve the case. You may shoot the enemies as soon as you find a weapon. As there is no other option for character interaction, this is how you'll deal with the Bates family as well.</desc>

Puffy's Saga is an overhead view maze game that represents a cutesy variant of Gauntlet. Each of the 20 levels has a quota of dots to eat before the level is completed. These levels are inhabited by foes who surround you and reduce your energy on contact. Meat restores 100 energy points each time - this total can go beyond its starting level of 500. You are armed with a gun, which not only kills foes but also turns many of them into edible energy-giving snacks.

Keys must be collected and used to open doors. Magic Goms allow you to use a map or a fire-bolt. Other available bonuses include invincibility periods and teleporting.</desc>

		<name>Puzznic</name>
		<desc>The challenge in each level of Puzznic is to maneuvre a selection of blocks into place so as to clear them all, by making them make contact with blocks of the same design. You control a cross-hair, which can move a block left or right, which can cause it to fall if there is no block under the space it would occupy.

There are many complications in terms of solving the levels. Moving platforms meaning that you need to move a block at a particular time, or in particular order, to prevent them being blockaded. In some situations there are an odd number of a certain type of block - solving these requires positioning two of the blocks one space apart, such that a move will result in a piece making contact with 2 others, and immediately removing all 3. You will also encounter blocks positioned on platforms suspended in space and gaps in level arrangements meaning that a certain number of blocks must be in place to make a certain move possible (by forming a stack, for example)

The game structure is slightly unusual, as after you complete each batch of four levels you get a choice of 2 sets of levels - you are progressing through an expanding matrix of levels, which means there are 2 sets on level 2, 3 on level 3, 4 on level 4, and so on. This means that there are a total of 220 screens in the game. Each screen is played against a time limit, and losing a level (either by running out of time, or by making a poor move and leaving an impossible position) loses one of your 3 lives.</desc>

The future: Mankind's space stations throughout the solar system are powered by a huge space reactor, called Astra. Astra is about to break down. The enemy race of Quadraliens has captured the reactor; now, contamination is rising and total failure is imminent. The last chance are six remotely controlled droids, which are to clean Astra and destroy the Quadrailen mother in Astras core.

You're controlling two robots in each of the 19 levels, cleaning up the contamination on your way. Gameplay is a variation of Sokoban: You've got to push spheres in the right direction to clear the way. However, the spheres are magnetically charged, meaning that they repell or attract each other. You've got to consider chain reactions. 

Before entering a level, you may chose which robots to take with you. Each droid has different abilities, like higher range of movement, higher capacity to carry contaminated materials, or a magnetic charge of its own.  You can blast your way out of hopeless situations with a limited number of detonators, and you may restart every level with already removed contamination staying removed. However, there's a time limit for the whole game in form of reactor core temperature and energy, so be quick!</desc>

		<desc>Quadrel is a puzzle game in which you must fill each piece of the selected layout with different colored paints, without painting two adjacent pieces the same color.

At the beginning of a game, you can select the desired image or layout, as well as whether you wish to play with unlimited time or not. You can also select the "Imposed" game mode, in which the game points which piece you must fill next. Each layout has a set amount of paint available for use, in four different colors: red, green, blue and yellow. The amount of brush stokes left for each color is indicated on your palette. Some layouts have a large amount of a particular color and a very small amount of another, while other layouts have a more even amount of each color. The goal is to plan well from the start, so as to avoid running out of a particular color that will be needed to finish the layout.

The game can be played in solitaire mode, against the computer, or against another human player on the same screen. There are no sound effects during gameplay, only music. If you manage to finish a layout, you can enter your name in a high score table.</desc>

Once you have collected 9 of each, you can choose a power-up form a range including various weapons, restart points (which effectively gives infinite continues when used with an emulator's 'snapshot' feature) and repairs to the ship. Destroying the whole of standard waves gives combined tokens which add one to each of the three colours.

The even-numbered waves scroll in a single direction, but include waves coming at you from other directions, even from within the screen in 3D. You can have up to 3 power-ups stored on your ship at a time, and choose one to activate by pressing F1-F3 - they all have limited firepower. Unusually, when you have no lives left, death results not in game over, but the loss of one of your power-ups (chosen by you).</desc>

		<name>Rambo III</name>
		<desc>Rambo's mission is set deep in Afghanistan, in the days when the Soviets occupied it, and America was putting this right (we won't mention who they enlisted to do so). Colonel Trautman has been kidnapped by the Soviets, and you've gone in there to rescuing him. Doing so is a three-part operation approximately following the plot of the film.

In the first part, you explore the building Trautman could be in, through a top-down view of the building. It is heavily protected by infra-red security beams, which when activated unleadsh the enemies. The locations of the beams are only apparent if you collect the special goggles. Other hazards include mines, trapdoors and booby-trapped doors, but there are enhanced weapons to collect.

Section two is identical to the first, except that it is located outside, the enemy are onto you from the start, and there are no traps. The final section changes to an Operation Wolf-style shoot 'em up, with a horde of tanks, foot soldiers and helicopters to face. Your gun can jam, which adds to the challenge of finally getting out alive.</desc>

		<name>Ranarama</name>
		<desc>The purpose of apprentice courses is for young people to learn a trade gradually, without putting yourself or your employers at risk. Unfortunately, nobody explained this to Wizard’s apprentice Mervyn, before he tried to cast a spell to make him irresistible to females, as the spell misfired, and made him attractive only to female frogs. However, his dungeon was soon invaded, and Mervyn was not killed, as he appeared to be a humble frog.

Viewed from above, the aim is to kill all 96 of the wizards who have invaded the dungeon, which is split into 8 levels, each made up of 16 screens and at least 50 rooms. To see what’s in a room he has to enter it, in a manner similar to the Switchblade games.

The game’s rather esoteric title comes from the way you obtain spells to upgrade the four different types of power you have (power, offence, defence and effect). When you meet a warlock you enter a mini game in which the letters RANARAMA are in random order, and by swapping pairs of letters in sequence you must form the full word in as little time as possible. This system of having a sub-game for collecting upgrades is similar to the ‘grappling’ concept in Paradroid.

This earns up to four of the Runes (Mysticism, Witchcraft, Magecraft and Runecraft), each of which can be used on one of the four types of power. The Magecraft offensive use is a fireball, defence for Runecraft makes you invisible to enemies, and the special effect for Witchcraft allows you to jump through space. Lose a life and you lose all these powers, and losing another life means it’s Game Over.</desc>

		<name>Red Heat</name>
		<desc>Red Heat is based on the Walter Hill film of the same name, starring Arnold Schwarzenegger and James Belushi. You take control of Soviet detective Ivan Danko (played by Schwarzenegger), who travels to Chicago in pursuit of the fearsome Georgian drug lord Victor Rosta. 

The game is essentially a side-scrolling beat'em up in the vein of Vigilante. As Danko, you proceed across four levels which follow the movie's original setting, where you are constantly attacked by members of the Cleanheads, a group of drug-dealers who are in business with Victor Rosta. To eliminate hostiles you can either punch them (slow but long-ranged) or head-butt them (close-ranged but faster). The only defensive move available is crouching, so as to avoid being hit - there is no jumping or any other evasive tactics. Occasionally, you can get hold of a handgun and fire six shots at the villains. Other items you can pick up will boost your health, make you temporarily invulnerable or give you access to bonus levels.

One peculiarity of Red Heat is its widescreen-like game area, and the fact that all characters are drawn from the waist up. This may find partial explanation in the first level, set in a Russian sauna where, as in the original movie scene, all characters are not wearing clothes.</desc>

Hopefully he's up to the challenge of escaping. If he is, he will find himself in the pyramid of Egypt with no easy way past leaders and their minions, and then engulfed in a web of traps in a Nazi base.

Rick Dangerous is a platform game across over 100 screens, in which Rick has his gun in one hand, and dynamite sticks in another. You must take a methodical approach to clearing each screen, as there are traps in place which will need memorizing and preempting where possible. Use the dynamite wisely, for enemies you can't get into the purely-horizontal range of your gun.</desc>

Your vehicle is equipped with a machine gun to help you out, and occasionally a weapons plane will fly in and drop additional power ups that can be collected. Some of these are the U.Z. canon, cruise missiles, and speed boost. Your car has a very limited amount of fuel, however more can be picked up along the way by crossing the halfway point of a level, or by collecting the red and green fuel spheres that appear in the road or after destroying certain enemies.  On many levels collecting fuel is critical otherwise you won't be able to reach the finish line.</desc>

Crucially, this involves shooting out the barriers at the side of the road (and avoiding falling into the gaps they create). You always play against another droid, who can be treated as friend or foe - pushing them into the gap at the side you've just created is a particularly neat trick, especially when playing a human opponent.

You are armed with a laser gun, which can be directed seperately from your main direction of motion. The roads include a range of hazards, including barriers and spikes, although bonus weaponry and a speed-up can be gained. Contact with these (or your opponent) will gradually drain your shields, and once these are gone you have little chance of surviving for long.</desc>

Based on the 1987 movie of the same name, RoboCop allows the player to control RoboCop. The majority of the game is a side scroller. RoboCop can punch unarmed citizens and shoot armed citizens. He can move left, right and duck but can not jump. Different weapons can be picked up from enemies, and power-ups to restore health and/or energy. Following levels, RoboCop will have to match a criminal's face to the proper mugshot and engage in a first-person shooting bonus round.</desc>

		<path>./Rotor (1989)(Arcana)[!].stx</path>
		<name>Rotor</name>
		<desc>You control a battle tank (the Rotor) which hovers in a 2D-labyrinth. Gravity pulls heavily on the Rotor, making it fall towards the ground. As any contact with walls or enemies is deadly, your main task is to avoid that. You may rotate your tank freely and accelerate via an afterburner, thus manoeuvring through the corridors -- imagine a mix of Asteroids and Lunar Lander to get an idea of the physics.

Scattered throughout the 18 different fortresses are boxes. Shoot these open to find either a) Fuel: this will replenish your supply, which is drained by shooting and accelerating. b) Sun crystals: Collect all to finish the mission. c) Bombs. They will explode in 30 to 60 seconds, destroying your ship. You can avoid that by leaving the screen quickly, or by picking the bomb up; this earns you major credits, but your ship drops much faster due to increased weight. d) Pearls. Collecting these advance the upgrade counter by one to three steps; you may activate the current upgrade at any time, which will improve your rotation speed, engine strength, weapon, shield etc. Boxes are emptied by carefully flying very, very close to them and activating a tractor field.

As if gravity and accurate flying wasn't challenging enough, the game also confronts you with various enemies. All of these are immobile and fire in a straight line; the sheer mass of them makes avoiding the bullets a difficult task nevertheless. Apart from turrets, there are attractors and repulsors who'll smash you into walls, and force fields that need to be deactivated by finding and shooting a switch.

The tricky labyrinths together with the short supply of fuel, weight constraints and clever upgrade system make Rotor more a game of tactics and accuracy than arcade action. Wild shooting and careless flying will deplete your fuel in no time; you'll have to progress carefully to discern traps in time.</desc>

Now you have returned as a ghost, with psychic powers in place of your physical ones. Starting out at your own funeral, you must follow conversations to find clues. One early task is to find items which boost your physical abilities. You have help from other deceased beings, starting with pub owner Joe Danby.

Scapeghost was Level 9's final adventure game, and it is in the same format as the existing ones, which makes for a text parser with additional graphics. Puzzles require instructions to be given to other characters. The game is split into 3 days, each of which can be played independently of each other - November Graveyard, Haunted House and Poltergeist.</desc>

Seymour Goes To Hollywood is a platform adventure, another Dizzy clone, this time replacing the egg character with an amorphous blob of unknown origin. Like in the Dizzy games, the main objective is to collect everything that isn't nailed down (using the fire button) to solve puzzles. In the upper left portion of the screen sits an inventory with three slots and besides that the score points and the energy bar. Seymour loses energy when touching dangerous objects and hazardous environments. When the bar gets empty, Seymour transforms into a pile of bones and the player loses one life. The game starts with three lives (shown as clack boards under the energy bar) and no way of saving progress.</desc>

		<desc>This vertically scrolling shoot 'em up varies from the standard for this style of game, as it also features a degree of horizontal scrolling. The screen area moves across as you reach the edge of the screen and reveals a whole new range of enemies. These include lots of static turrets as well as cannon-fodder waves of enemies.

There are 6 levels and each level starts and ends with you travelling through a tunnel, and emerging on the other side faced with a new graphical setting, be it industrial, space or woodland. After clearing the last level the tunnel leads back to the first level, so there is no real ending to the game. There are no end bosses, instead each level ends with a more difficult part with a large ground structure and increased enemies and turrets. There are 3 difficulty levels to choose from, and a 2 player mode.

Interestingly, the game was not only released for Amiga and PC, but also as a coin-op  machine for arcades. The arcade version is identical to the Amiga version, the arcade PCB  even contains parts of the Amiga operating system.</desc>

Set your difficulty/realism level and time period (early means less tech for juicier targets, later means tougher escorts, more tech, lousier targets).

You can choose among practice run against some old hulks, recreate historical convoy attacks, go on a single patrol, or go on your own campaign, which lets you go multiple patrols until you die, get promoted, or survive the war.

The first task is to place essentials such as housing, transport links, schools, factories and shops. There are 50 types of these, allowing for homes of all standards and different types of businesses. Make sure to consider which sites are effective for which tasks. Some power sources pollute, others don't but are more expensive. Taxes must be raised to ensure an income, and then portions allocated to public services such as policing and roads. Earthquakes, floods and fires are all emergency situations that must be dealt to contain any damage.

Successful mayoring will cause the small village to grow into a town, then a city and finally a metropolis. As the city's size grows so do it's needs. Commercial buildings may suddenly find that they need an airport to expand trade, or housing may find itself changing rapidly as vast amounts of people come and leave.

The game also includes 8 pre-defined time-limited scenarios, with specific challenges and targets. The environment varies in each game (especially if you have the Terrain Editor add on), and this should affect your choices.</desc>

		<desc>The world of Light is vanishing... No more glimmer, no more warmth, not even the slightest spark. Only you, Skrull the Barbarian, the incredible bastard son of the unnatural love between the Sun Woman and the Shadow Man, can free the Light again. But the gloomy world of Darkness is full of dangers...

The game represents a Barbarian clone, where you should select the available icon to allow your protagonist seen in third-person side-scrolling view perform the action. Right and left mouse buttons clicks invoke opposite actions. For example, left mouse button click on 'Move Left' icon will move Skrull left, while right mouse button click will move him right. There are seven icons to use: Stop, Move, Run, Jump, Use Sword, Up, Down. Several items may be collected in three inventory slots to be used later. In particular, such item may be a key dropped from dead Dragon to unlock a certain door.

The environment is labyrinth of dark, damp, and dangerous caves with many obstacles such as gaps to be jumped over and many different enemies such as tarantulas, vampire bats, or dragons. The key to world of Light's salvation lies hidden somewhere here and should be found by you finally.</desc>

		<desc>The year is 1999. The world's most popular television show is Smash T.V., an ultra-violent contest between two armed-to-the-teeth combatants, set loose in a series of deadly arenas that are filled to bursting with hordes of mindless beasts and killer robots. The aim of the game is to blast everything in sight and try to grab more cash and prizes than the other guy. Toaster ovens, VCRs, fancy cars and luxury holidays are there for the taking... for anyone who can survive long enough to enjoy them.

Smash T.V. is an insane shoot-em-up from the brain of Eugene Jarvis, creator of Robotron: 2084. It retains that game's frantic style of play and two-joystick control method, but adds plenty of gore, violence, a hint of satire and that all-important two player mode.</desc>

You'll have a copilot that will help you telling what's going on every moment. 
You can avoid missiles using your skills, using chaff or... if you can't, you can use your parachute!</desc>

Some treasures give you bonus points, others can form magic spells to help deal with the enemies. To make the game more difficult, each level has a time limit in which it must be completed.</desc>

		<name>Spindizzy Worlds</name>
		<desc>On it's most basic level, Spindizzy Worlds is, like its predecessor, similar to Marble Madness. Controlling GERALD, you must move through the isometrically viewed landscape (largely flick-screen on the ST). There are two skill levels; the harder one features more of the precarious ledges and falls of Spindizzy. Each one takes you to a different matrix of levels, which can be played in different orders and each consist of 10 screens, with a bonus level at the end.

You have limited energy, which can be recharged by collecting crystals. Fuel is limited, and is reduced by contact with hazards - generating a replacement GERALD takes time. There are many gates which are opened by running into spaces of the same colour. There are also aliens to avoid, and most movement is along thin slippery ledges with heavily inertia-based controls.</desc>

A prophet determines that a world war will occur in seven years instigated by a mysterious leader. To avoid this, one ruler of the world must be determined in this beat 'em up involving six rulers: U.S.A.'s Ronald Regan, the U.K.'s Margaret Thatcher, the USSR's Mikhail Gorbachev, South Africa's PW Botha, Iran's Ayathollah Khomeini, and Pope John Paul II.</desc>

		<name>Spot</name>
		<desc>A puzzle game loosely featuring licensing from the 7Up soft drink. The gameplay involves up to 4 players, which can be either human or computer, each taking on spots of a particular colour. Starting from opposite corners, they take it in turns to move, either by 'reproducing' one of their spots to form another one in an adjacent square, or by making a jump, losing the square you did have but taking one two spaces away.

When a piece lands next to one of another colour, that piece changes colour into that of their opponent. The winner of each round is either the last player with any pieces left, or the player who has the most pieces left when the level is full.</desc>

		<name>Spy vs Spy</name>
		<desc>MAD magazine's comic strip of the same name comes to life in this game which was designed for one or two players. The split-screen shows both spies at the same time. Play with a friend or against the machine. 
 
The black spy and the white spy are out to outsmart each other before the time bell rings. Find the needed objects (money, passport, secret plans and airport door key) by searching rooms in the embassy, which include desks, file cabinets and other furniture. Foil your opponent by setting creative booby traps in the various rooms (a bomb in a dresser drawer, for instance). Traps can be disarmed with objects found in rooms (a water bucket from a firebox on the wall will disarm the bomb in the prior example). When all the items are together in the secret briefcase, head for the airport door. 
 
Fights ensue when both spies enter the same room and are armed with clubs.</desc>

		<name>Stack Up</name>
		<desc>A good alternate title for this one would be Rows - not the kind you have when your wife finds lipstick on your shirt collar, but as an equivalent of Columns. The gameplay is essentially the same - groups of 3 variably-colored blocks fall towards the bottom of a 6x18 grid, and you must arrange them into groups of 3 of the same colour - except that the blocks are grouped horizontally rather than vertically.

Each individual brick falls as far as it can when you place the trio, so they won't necessarily all end up on the same line. Blocks fall as far as possible to fill gaps when lines are completed, so there are never gaps in the arrangement the way you get in Tetris. Each level sets you a target number of lines to form - 4 or 5 in a row count as 2 and 3 lines respectively for this calculation, a lá Klax. Horizontal lines score the least, with diagonals the most lucrative and vertical in between (this change from Columns makes sense considering the different building method).</desc>

		<desc>The Planet Novenia has been attacked by the Egrons, who snuck in by disguising their craft as the protected Starglider species, which Novenia's automated defenses were programmed not to shoot. 

Your task is to fight them off using only an obsolete Airborne Ground Attack Vehicle. This was designed as the ultimate combat machine, with sophisticated hardware up to Draziw Yarg's high standards. It has a fully-rechargeable shield, plasma drive unit, an inbuilt scanner and 10,000-sector map, a top speed of 2550 Urads and two homing missiles.

The game is viewed from within AGAV's cockpit, with control over speed, weapon targeting and firing. There are several control options to decide exactly how the craft works, with fixed or floating sighting, and the option of automatic centering, allowing you to balance the game between easy sighting and advanced shooting ranges.

Repair depots must be visited frequently, as they can refill the weapon bays as well as repairing the ship. Crucially, the Egron Stargliders need 3 missiles to shoot down, so at least 1 visit to a depot is required to complete this job, at which point you move up to the next, harder, level.</desc>

		<name>Strike Force Harrier</name>
		<desc>Rod Hyde was always determined to produce the most realistic and advanced flight simulations ever, and this early attempt at recreating the Harrier is an example of that. There are 3 skill levels, as well as two practice modes - one for the rudiments of flight and the other for combat. The action-centered nature of the title means that it can be seen as an advanced shoot 'em up rather than a pukka flight simulator.

Acquiring a lock on enemy planes and tanks is made easier by the advanced targeting technology of the planes, and escaping enemy fire is aided by the vectored thrust system. Shooting out the tanks clears ground space to set up your own bases, which must then be defended. VTOL (vertical take-off and landing) is correctly implemented, although more traditional horizontal take-offs should be used when space permits. The full range of weapons are provided; experience will tell you which to use in which situations, based on enemy volume and range.</desc>

		<name>Subbuteo</name>
		<desc>Subbuteo recreates the famous table football game, which makes for something very different from Sensible/Kick Off/FIFA style games. It's effectively a turn-based strategy game of sorts, as each player has 30 seconds to make their move (within a 30 minute match length), which involves first selecting a player, then aiming the direction in which he will be flicked, then the power and swerve of the flick are determined by the length of time the button is held down for. 

With any luck, your player will hit the ball, and hit it such that it doesn't leave the playing area, and doesn't hit an opponent. If any of those rules are violated, possession passes to the opposition. Before each flick, the team not in possession can make a 'defensive flick' involving moving one of their players into a potential blocking position (without hitting the ball or an opponent, as this is a foul).</desc>

As before, the racing is overhead view and against a field of 9 computer cars, with championship points awarded for finishing positions. The computer drivers now take on the humourous names from Lotus 1, such as 'Ayrton Sendup' and 'T Hairy Bootson'. The most noticeable addition is a split screen 2 player mode. 

The power ups have been changed around from the original, with the handling improvements gone, so as to put more of an emphasis on learning to control the slippery cars. These have been replaced by further weapons and more engine upgrades.

The questions from the original have been replaced by mock driving test questions about stopping distances and the like - as before, money and points are won and lost depending on your answers.</desc>

		<name>Tangram</name>
		<desc>For around 4000 years the Chinese have been enthralled by this puzzle concept. It consists of a set of 7 shapes, representing squares, triangles and trapezoids, which must be arranged to form a pre-defined pattern. In this version there are 200, representing things such as animals and buildings.

The shapes are on the right of the screen, and you move the mouse cursor over one to select it, then place it onto the shape as required. They can be rotated using the right mouse button. 

All this is done against a time limit. As well as points for clearing a level, you get bonus time for completing them with time to spare. This bonus time can then be used on later levels if you run out of the allotted time. Once you have no bonus time, you can dig into your main score to provide more time.

There are two difficulty levels - the Novice level sees time elapse half as quickly as the Expert mode, and presents the levels in an approximate order of difficulty, whereas in Expert mode they are in randomised order.</desc>

Contact with other bikes or the scenery gradually increases the damage percentage, which will eliminate you at 100%. Crashing results in an external replay of your final moments.

Joystick and mouse control options exist, with the mouse being ultimately faster but harder to learn. 125, 250 and 500cc options exist, with the difficulty higher on the more powerful bikes. You can contest a full season, single race, or simply practice on a free track. 

16 circuits are featured, from Suzuka and Misano to Rijeka and Philip Island, with races over 5-50 laps. Your opponents are seven factory Suzuki riders from various classes at the time, including 1993 500cc World Champion Kevin Schwantz.</desc>

The game takes place towards the end of the movie: the Addams Family has been evicted from their home by a court order issued by a backstabbing attorney (there's one for the books), Tully Alford. Even worse, the other Addamses: Morticia, Pugsley, Wednesday, Granny and Lurch have gone missing.

As Gomez, you must tour the Addams mansion in search of your lost family, battling out mysterious monsters and evading traps, and eventually face your nemesis, Tully.</desc>

The First Samurai is a platform action game very much similar to other platform games, but with a medieval oriental touch to it in addition to various unique features.

Arriving in the new unknown land, you are defenceless hence your fists and kicks. But as you journey forth, you'll find your trusty magical sword as well as throwing weapons such as knives and axes. With your martial art skills, your enemy best beware with those sudden moves that may prove fatal!

The First Samurai offers a wide array of weapons, special items and other objects. Combat is usually melee, either relying on your punch or kicks or using the magical sword to slash some pretty skillful blows in whatever direction possible.

Monsters are forever regenerating but food for health is plentiful. It actually takes an effort to be killed...</desc>

		<desc>This is a vertical platformer with horizontal wrap-around. For the entertainment of the futuristic masses, you play a criminal that has been inserted into a mechanical body with the promise that if you succeed in surviving through all the levels (there are many and they are hard), you will be set free.
   You start each level at the bottom, near pooling liquid which will soon rise, at your immediate peril. Navigate the level from bottom to the exit at the top before the liquid rises and kills you. There are many other foes that fly around, causing you damage and basically annoying you to spit.
   Most levels must be navigated through a series of keyed gates, doors, or portals. These shaped keys are scattered around the map and must by picked up and used only on the gates they match individually.
   Twist: You can only carry one special weapon (triple shot, laser beam, or vertical shot) and one tool (key, liquid-freeze, or a red herring) at a time.
   This game requires a lot of memorization of enemy movement patterns and optimum routes.
   A unique feature is that when you die, you can watch a replay and take over at any point to continue your game.
   You can also hit the HELP button at the start of each level to view a map, helping you plan your route.</desc>

		<desc>One day, a kiwi tribe was having fun and games outside the zoo, only to be kidnapped by the evil-minded Leopard Seal, who plans to sell them at the black market. Fortunately, during the kidnapping process, Tiki, leader of the tribe, managed to escape the sack, and her job is to rescue Phee-Phee and the other kiwis scattered around New Zealand, and are held in cages in various locations that include Auckland, Rotorua, Waitomo Caves, Strait Cook, and Mt. Cook. 

If Tiki doesn't rescue a kiwi in a limited amount of time, the devil will appear and try to kill her. When Tiki reaches the outskirts of each city, except Strait Cook, there is a boss waiting to meet Tiki, and kill her by using their own choice of weapons. Also making the rescue mission difficult are several nasties that attempt to throw their own weapons, like bombs and arrows, at her. To defeat these enemies, Tiki shoots at them using her crossbow and arrows. More often than not, when Tiki shoots at enemies, they will leave behind pieces of fruit that she can pick up for points. However, it is likely that Tiki may get other weapons or the letters E, X, T, E, N, and D. Collecting all these letters will result in an extra life, and as for the weapons, they include laser shots, bombs, and fireballs. 

In some levels, a few areas are located further up than just left or right, and the only way that Tiki can go up is by snatching something off the enemy that gives her the ability to fly up. Other areas are underwater, and when Tiki goes underwater, her oxygen  meter decreases, so she has to rise up to the surface again to restore her oxygen levels. Apart from her own weapons, Tiki is able to squirt water at enemies if she gets to the top of the water.</desc>

However, if The Punisher can raise $500,000, he can pay off an informant for the location of the biggest criminal in Manhattan, The Kingpin.  Working with a time limit and financed by The Trust, The Punisher only has a short time to complete enough missions to raise that much money.

The Punisher primarily plays from a top-down perspective, where the player moves The Punisher through the streets and alleys of New York, entering buildings and taking out enemies with a range of weaponry.  The Punisher also drives to locations in his Battle Van, where the player controls the van from a first-person perspective, to the mission’s address.  The Punisher also has a scrolling mode when The Punisher scuba dives and knifes underwater assailants on the way to boats.</desc>

This is done by first shooting the ghosts using a gun, and then by using a photon beam (by holding down the fire button) to suck them in for storage in the backpack. Photon recharges can be collected, as can the potential for an improved shot, as well as a shield. The Ghostbusters mascot Slimer also appears as a power-up, which hovers around your character killing ghosts on contact.</desc>

As a pilot in the "Ground Defense Games", you must make your way through several arenas built on different planets. You can choose from four different ships, each with different properties (better/worse acceleration, top speed, or turning speed).

When you enter the arena, you are given several pyramids that you must defend from robotic drones sent out to collapse them. In addition to defending your pyramids, you must destroy the spawning centers that spawn not only drones, but an array of robotic fighters to hunt you down.

When you destroy a fighter, sometimes it will leave behind an upgrade pod (shield, turbo, power, or twin-fire). There are also tracks that you can latch your ship onto to travel the perimeter of the arena quickly.

At the end of each round, your performance is reviewed, and if you did good, your ship is upgraded and you move on to the next round.</desc>

		<name>Time Bandit</name>
		<desc>Time Bandit is a Gauntlet-style arcade game with text adventure elements.

Having nothing to do with the Terry Gilliam movie Time Bandits, this game utilises the time-travel theme for a fast-paced variation on the good old Gauntlet concept. Your bandit visits 16 different worlds throughout time to grab as much loot as possible and, in the long run, do some universe-saving stuff as well.

Each of the 16 locations -- featuring such varied places like a medieval arena, a bomb factory, a wrecked spaceship and a ghost town -- is basically a labyrinth filled with treasure and -- you guessed it -- monsters. You've got to dodge these or blast them with your weapon, while collecting keys, opening doors and searching for the exit. Although theoretically each location consists of 16 sub-levels, these are merely the basic layout flipped or mirrored, some items redistributed and the monster speed increased. After completing a level, you return to the world map, where you may freely choose the next challenge (nice) and save your game (very nice).

Interestingly, Time Bandit tries to spice up the fast arcade action with text adventure scenes. Due to this strange mixture, you will occasionally bump into persons or computer consoles with which interaction is possible. For example, you've got to explore and repair the damaged spaceship Excalibur. However, the parser is crude at best; you'll have to know exactly what to do, or else you will trigger no reaction. 

Gaming veterans will discover a score of elements of and allusions to arcade classics, such as Gauntlet (obviously), Pac-Man, Centipede, Bomberman, and others.</desc>

		<name>Titan</name>
		<desc>Titan is a 2D arcade game / puzzle game hybrid.

For some reason, mad professors of the future tend to invent strange entertainment games in which every participant dies. Professor Hybrys’ variant is called Titan and involves a ball, a control unit and 80 labyrinths. Your objective is either to destroy all destructible blocks in each level by hitting them with the sphere, or to pilot it to the exit. The black ball is beyond your control; it will bounce straight or diagonally through the labyrinth with constant speed. You move the control unit, a small box, with you are to position in a way that the ball bounces off it in the desired direction. You can also catch the sphere by quickly moving over it, and then release it in a direction of your choice.

The labyrinths not only contain harmless, destructible blocks, but also increasingly difficult hazards. If the sphere or your control unit hit a skull symbol, one of your nine lives is lost. Teleporters exchange the position of you and the ball, wall pieces can be pushed around or destroyed by your unit, floor tiles will grow into walls when you pass over them too often. The high game speed can be slowed down by holding the space key – a very useful option in tricky situations.

Titan mixes an arcade game foundation (requiring quick reflexes and good nerves) with puzzle game elements (requiring logical thinking to beat the complex levels). The challenge is to control the sphere accurately, yet indirectly.</desc>

		<desc>The hero of the game is a young jungle-man named Toki. One day the evil wizard Dr. Stark kidnaps his girlfriend Wanda. When Toki tries to save her, he is turned into a monkey! Now Toki has to find Dr. Stark in his palace, to rescue Wanda, and to become a human being again!

It is a platform game with a lot of various levels: jungle, underwater, volcanic caves, on the ice... Toki's only weapons are spitting on the enemies or jumping on them and crashing them. There are many possibilities to upgrade his spitting "weapon";  for example, if he finds an upgrade, he can spit fireballs. 

This game is ported from an older arcade version.</desc>

		<name>tom &amp; jerry</name>
		<desc>Tom &amp; Jerry is a platformer based on the two cartoon animals. The player takes the role of Jerry who has to navigate the five levels while collecting every piece of cheese. Besides the usual platforming obstacles there is a time limit and Tom who tries to catch Jerry. The player needs to avoid Tom but can also use the environment to get rid of him temporarily: a bowling ball on the head knocks him out or a prepared floor lets him slip. The main levels are side-scrolling, but between each level the game switches to a behind-the-shoulder perspective. Then Jerry has to run through a tunnel while collecting cheese and avoiding dynamite or bombs.</desc>

		<name>Tower Toppler</name>
		<desc>You play a small green guy who needs to blow up eight towers, because their presence is somehow poisoning the water of planets which could potentially be ideal colonies. Unfortunately you need to get to the top of these towers to blow them up. 

You make your way up to the top of the tower via walkways around the outside of the towers. You need to jump over, kick, and run from various enemies in your journey to the top. Most vertical movement is achieved by jumping onto moving ledges at the right moment. 

The game was considered revolutionary in its time for its graphic technique. As the main character walked around the outside of the tower, the character was fixed in the middle of the screen while the tower itself rotated. This gave it a pseudo-3D effect.

Towers are linked together via a voyage through the sea in your trusty MK.7 submarine. This plays out as a side-scrolling collect-'em-up in which bonus points can be obtained.</desc>

		<name>Toyota Celica GT Rally</name>
		<desc>A detailed recreation of rallying licensed from Toyota Great Britain. Driving on gravel, asphalt and ice is involved, with each race made up of a series of short stages to complete. After each stage, your times are compared with those of your rivals, whose names are subtly changed from the real drivers of the day. Up to four human players can be involved, taking it in turns.

As visibility is sometimes low, and the exact curvature of a corner isn't always obvious from the apex, a co-driver is provided to give pace notes. These can be adjusted before you take to the track, specifying what is defined as 'hard left' and how early the warning should be given.

The steering sensitivity can be adjusted, and you can choose between automatic centering, and a push-the-opposite-way-to-centre mode, but more unusual is the option to race with the steering directions reversed - definitely one for advanced players.</desc>

		<desc>Tracksuit Manager varied the conventional Football Manager game style in a number of ways. You take charge of an international team aiming to qualify for and then play in the European Championships and World Cup. This means there is no transfer market, just a pool of 100 eligible players from which a squad of 22 is selected. You can view reports on each player's ability and form at any stage of the squad and team selection process. You can arrange friendly matches to try out players and ensure that the squad plays together as much as possible.

The matches are presented as a running commentary, with a small graphic indicating which area of the pitch the ball is in. A wide range of tactical options are available to dictate the team's passing style, defensive approach and so on, and in another first you can give specific instructions to individual players (maybe telling a particularly pacy defender to man-mark a dangerous opposition winger instead of staying in a set position).</desc>

		<name>Trivial Pursuit - Genus Edition</name>
		<desc>This is the earliest home computer incarnation of Horn Abbot International Ltd's classic board game, Trivial Pursuit. The game involves answering questions on one of six subject categories to gain moves, and answering questions on special squares to gain one of the six 'Wedges' you need to gain the right to take on the final winning question. Questions are aimed at British players - many entertainment questions are based on British TV, and sport questions relate to popular British sports.

Two game modes are available:- single player (which involves answering questions against the clock) and multiplayer (where you can take on up to five human-controlled players). The computer reveals the answer, and you select 'yes' or 'no' to tell it whether you got it right.

The question categories are exactly the same as the board game, however two different question styles are added to take advantage of computer technology - some questions relate to a picture or diagram and some relate to a piece of music. 

One additional feature not available in the board game is a statistical analysis of the number and type of questions answered correctly. This can be split into the performances of all the players, or the performance of an individual player within the six categories. It is especially useful at the end of the game, when choosing which category a player must answer to win the game.</desc>

The game never played like a "shoot-'em-up" - too much persistant firing was never much use - and required more tactics.</desc>

The field of battle is a toroidal grid on which your tri-colored half-sphere base cells sit awaiting your protection.  The invading cells (also tri-colored spheres) attempt to bond together into groups and destroy your bases.  You destroy the infecting cells by lobbing antibodies (also tri-colored spheres) at them.  Hit an infector with the right color shot and it is destroyed.  The catch is that you have a limited amount of each color of ammunition.  Run out of a color and the game is over.  The situation is also complicated by Spitters, enemies that appear and spew out new attacking cells if you take too long to complete a level.</desc>

		<name>Volfied</name>
		<desc>Volfied is a home conversion of an arcade coin-op developed by Taito in the late '80s. The game is very similar to Qix -- the player takes control of an object whose purpose is to roam the screen, forming shapes and removing them from the play field. By way of reward, a picture is gradually revealed in the removed areas of the screen. The borders of the area which the player has not cleared become the border of the area the player's pointer can move along.

The player's object must avoid contact with any of the enemies which float around the screen, as this will weaken and eventually destroy it. Barriers limit which parts of the border boxes can be formed through. The goal is to clear 80% or more of the screen, and each additional percent adds bonus points.

As an arcade conversion this game allows for one or two player games in three difficulty levels, but offers no passwords or saved games across its numerous levels.</desc>

The Beershooting event requires you to shoot a 5 beer glass targets faster than your opponent, but this is not too easy if you get nervous.Player 1 moves the joystick to the right to draw their gun, while Player 2 must move theirs to the left. Once the gun is drawn, the crosshairs are used to line up the target. Press the joystick button to fire. A beating heart shows the degree of your nervousness in the display. 

Quid-spitting requires that you bite off the right amount of tobacco and chew it to just the right consistency before you determine what angle to spit it into the pot. This requires some fancy joystick handling. To lift your arm and bite off the quid, you must move the joystick forward.To chew, you must move the joystick fast to the left and right. Don't chew it too long or too short. To stop chewing, you must move the joystick forward. Once that is done you must pull the stick back to determine the strength. Click and hold the joystick button to determine the right angle. Press the joystick button to spit. Timing is the key. 

The Milking event has a rhythmically heaving udder indicating the beat that you must move the joystick. To fill the cans, the joystick must be moved in a predetermined pattern, but it must be moved rythmically with the udder. You can elbow your opponent to get the upper hand by moving your joystick to the right and pressing the joystick button. 

Dancing requires a complicated routine of joystick movements to do certain dance moves while keeping the beat. Lose the beat and the other guys bash the piano player on the head causing him to stop playing. You must buy the piano player another beer to have him resume playing. 

The Eating competition is the final event. Dip the spoon into the stew. Balance the spoon. Slurp. Chew. Swallow. and drink. Simple? No. If you get some out of order, you get delayed by belching. Dip the spoon by moving the joystick back. Balance the spoon by moving the joystick to the left and right.; Once leveled, slurp. Chew by again moving the joystick to the right and left. To swallow, pull the joystick back and press the joystick button. Finish it off with a drink before you dip the spoon in again, by moving the joystick forward.</desc>

You're the contestant in 15 different locations, in which you must show 4 judges your skills, from speed to trick-surfing as you ride those waves. Points are awarded based how artistic the technique was. Judging the flow of the waves, and avoiding wreckage and other hazards, is crucial to maximising the score.</desc>

		<name>Wings of Death</name>
		<desc>Wings of Death is a vertically scrolling shoot'em'up with a fantasy setting. You start out as a small insect, flying through a deranged castle filled with hostile animals and monsters.

The upgrade system is rich, and differs somewhat from genre conventions. As you upgrade, your insect turns into a more powerful bat or a mighty dragon. Shooting enemies reveals the various upgrades, and picking up several upgrades of the same kind upgrades that particular weapon level after level. Enemies may also release anti-powerups, marked by a skull. These will downgrade your weapon or draw your energy level.

After fighting the end boss of the castle, a three-headed dragon, you move onto a jungle, a swamp and further... That is, if you survive. Wings of Death has an unparalleled number of bullets and enemy objects on-screen for its time and platform, the maximum number being reported as 95. Coded by former demo programmers, the game also runs in full 50 or 60 Hz scrolling while playing digitised music even on an Atari ST, thanks to inventive hardware tricks used in few other commercial games. It also utilises the extra colour palettes of the Atari STe.</desc>

		<name>Wizball</name>
		<desc>In Wizball the player takes the role of the friendly wizard Wiz who can turn himself into a green ball that is able to defend his world against the color-sucking enemies who have turned his once brightly colored Wizworld into a drab planet. With his trusty feline companion Catelite, the wizard will restore the colors to the world by retrieving them from defeated enemies.

The player starts out as a bouncing green ball that can shoot and be put into more or less heavy rotation to move slowly or faster, physically correct through the side-scrolling levels. The first task is to upgrade the ball by shooting the first non-moving enemies, and collect the green bubbles that are left by them. In order to stand a chance against the following moving enemy waves, some upgrades are a must. First and foremost, complete control over the ball should be activated (i.e. flying through the levels), a shield sheltering the top and bottom of the player's should be acquired, and two-way fire (left/right) should be obtained.

But the extra needed to advance in Wizball is your friend Catelite who will, once summoned, take the form of a small green satellite that will imitate the ball's movement, or can be directly controlled by the player. Besides upping Wiz' fire power, Catelite is able to collect paint drops left by a certain kind of defeated enemies until the respective color pot is filled up. There's three colors available (red, green and blue), and several different combinations of them must be collected to complete a level and restore it to former colorfulness. Every color combination collected will send Wiz to a bonus stage, then to his laboratory where one of the power-ups can be made permanently.

The game also features a bunch of multi-player modes, there's even a two-player cooperative mode amongst them.</desc>

		<desc>Manage a stable of 3 wannabe heavyweight world champions in this unusual twist of the standard football management style. The option are selected through an icon-based system, representing your office.

Training your fighters involves deciding which areas they should work on, considering their strengths and weaknesses and any damage inflicted in previous fights, and those of their next opponent. 

There are 97 of these in the game, so reaching the top of the rankings will take 15-20 fights, just like real life. Choosing a beatable opponent, but one who can get your fight as high up the Friday Night bill as possible, negotiating the best financial deal, and a mutually agreeable dare, are the main considerations.

Two different governing bodies are included in the game, each with subtly different rules, and a fight in one set of rules won’t be viewed quite as significantly by the other.

The matches are presented from the commentary box, with the 2 expert analysts exchanging textual descriptions of the key punches, and who is dong the best (a clue to how any judges’ decision would go). Before and during the fights you can instruct your man as to what tactics to adopt.</desc>

Once you pick your team you can also select which players you want on the field, so that you can round out the team's strengths and weaknesses. Also provided are modes for single exhibition matches, either against the computer or against a friend.

The action is viewed from above with large player sprites. Violent play is encouraged as there are no free kicks. Whereas later sports games often carry heavy focus on the attention to detail, this game is rather simplified -- you can only control the player closest to the ball, for example, and it is missing many of the rules of soccer such as penalty flags and offsides.</desc>

		<name>Wreckers</name>
		<desc>Wreckers is an isometric sci-fi action game with strategy elements.

Robotic droids roll quietly through the corridors of space station Beacon 04523N, automated computers calculate routes for interstellar traffic. Three human officers sleep in cryogenic tanks, awakened only for routine system checks – or in case of an emergency. With a hum, the cryogenic control springs on-line as Beacon’s long-range sensors detect incoming lifeforms.

Controlling one of the on-board officers, you have to defend the station against swarms of plasmodian spores (the “Wreckers”) showering down on Beacon and seeping into its four sections. While the spores approach, you can suck them out of space with a gigantic hoover-like space hose. Once they settle onto the stations hull, jump into the space suit and spray infected areas with a cleansing agent. Undetected spores will seep into the station’s corridors, where you must hunt them down with a plasma shots and avoid being shot in return.

In addition, up to ten droids are under your (indirect) control. Ranging from cleaners to fighters to engineers, these automatons will act independently, but can be sent to key locations within the station -- i.e. infected areas. As your officer gains experience through battles, he will be promoted to higher ranks, enabling him to construct more efficient fighter robots in the station’s droid factory.

Since plasmodians running rampant in the station will cause system malfunctions, your main goal is to clear infections quickly and make sure that Beacon continues to function properly. To make things worse, an self-destruct mechanism will explode the station in 60 minutes unless all signs of spore activity cease. 

Effective droid construction and assignment, quick reactions to approaching swarms and good reflexes thus combine into a challenging race against time that makes Wreckers stand out as a clever twist of the “alien invasion” action archetype.</desc>

		<desc>Xenon is the obscure and mysterious predecessor to the much better known Xenon 2: Megablast. The game is actually nothing like its sequel, with completely different control scheme and gameplay. The plot overlaps however, with the Xenites making their first attempt to control the galaxy.

Xenon is essentially an overhead shooter, where the player controls the ship and moves around the screen. However, the difference between Xenon and its sequel is that here the player actually controls the movement of the playfield (up or down) by simply moving the ship in the direction of choice. To do this in the sequel, players need to slam your ship against the bottom of the screen and pull back on the stick in order to reverse-scroll the playfield.

It also features a 3D playfield (some enemies, for example, will be mounted on hills of sort, where players can't shoot them). To combat these the player can transform its tank into a plane. The game then switches to the more familiar gameplay style as seen in other vertically scrolling shooters. The plane has to transform back into a tank again to combat most ground units.

In Xenon, upgrades are taken from destroyed enemies.</desc>

A small band of engineers has been dispatched to combat the Xeno threat before it takes over all the space stations and, eventually, your homeworld.  Assemble your band of engineers and fight the Xenos on each station, striving to either clear it or abandon it.  You start out with a standard issue laser, but can pick up additiona weapons as you find them, including Phasers, Lightning Rifles, Poofer guns, and bombs.

Xenophobe was originally an arcade coin-op by Bally/Midway, released in 1987.  Gameplay premise and setting is heavily inspired/influenced by the movie Aliens.</desc>

		<desc>In Zombi you control a team of four intrepid travelers, who have landed their helicopter on the roof of a shopping centre in the hope of finding fuel. The problem is that, with Hell full, Zombies are walking the earth, devouring humans as they please.

Zombi is a point and click adventure game in which you control the four characters (Alexandre, Sylvie, Yannick and Patrick) in turn, taking each of them individually through the abandoned complex. Lots of potentially-useful items have been left behind, some stored in cupboards - work out what they could be used for. 

Try to find a weapon with which to attack the zombies - bare-hands fighting only works for a few attempts before your character is worn out. Dead zombies should be placed in the freezer in the basement to stop them re-emerging. You have free rein over the shopping mall, and can use the bed shops to rest and the food shops for nourishment. Be wary of the dark and zombie-filled basement though.</desc>

		<desc>This is a top down vertically scrolling shooter, in which you start off as a motorbike. You are quite vulnerable to attack at first, but power ups come in the form of a Sega van which you have to dock with. The first time you dock you get double fire, the second time gives you a rocket, the third gives a rear force field and the fourth invulnerablility.

By destroying cars and bikes that appear on your way, you can collect A-F letters. Collecting A through to D allows you change into a sportscar which is less vulnerable to attack, but not as nimble. Collect all the letters in order to be able to transform into a high tech plane. This is the final stage of one of the five missions. Only the high tech plane can guide you to your destination in which your main target is hiding.

There is also time limit in which you have to complete the mission. It is advisable to transform into the high tech plane as fast as it is possible.

Picking up flags gives you bonus points with 10,000 points gaining you an extra life.</desc>
